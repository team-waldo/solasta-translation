"Narration/&NecromancyTextObj24","A rune or glyph of some unknown type."
"Narration/&NecromancyTextObj25","A mystical symbol, possibly inactive."
"Narration/&NecromancyTextObj26","What's wrong with all these mirrors?"
"Narration/&NecromancyTextObj27","A very odd painting."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_01","The bridge is closed for now."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_02","The Council is in the opposite direction."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_01","There's trouble on the road. Please remain in town for now."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_02","Please stay in the high town for now."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MaddyGreenisle01","Clear skies, citizens!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_AnnieBagmordah01","We'll talk after your swearing-in."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_AnnieBagmordah02","I'll be with you in a minute."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HugoRequer01","Let's get you deputized, first, shall we?"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HugoRequer02","I'm in the middle of something - sorry!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_GorimIronsoot01","Lord Carran said not to bother you… yet."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_GorimIronsoot02","Come back later. I'm busy with the accounts."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_KarelMartel","Lord Carran said no more beer… sorry!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark01","I'm busy. Come back later."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark02","Oh, it's you. Well, I'm still busy. Thank you for your service."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark03","Look who's here - Caer Cyflen's rising stars!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark04","Council business is not my business. Be on your way."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark05","We knew this war was looming. We'll prevail, as always."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton01","Go get killed in the Badlands…"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton02","You were still filling your diapers when I killed my first ghoul…"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton03","I heard your stories. Not impressive."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton04","I know everyone in this city… and everyone knows me."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton05","You're still here? I'm sure there are some rats to kill in some cave somewhere."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton06","I know that look. Something happened… something bad."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton07","Don't get too cocky. These Soraks have more tricks up their sleeves."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton08","That crown's a trouble magnet, I can tell."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton09","Still alive? Good. There's more cleaning up to do."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton10","I'm better, sure. Doesn't mean I can't have a couple of beers…"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton11","Well, I handled some unfinished business… feels good. I'm celebrating."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton12","If you're looking for a sharp blade… I'm your man."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton13","Any time, friends… I mean, any time after I finish this beer."

"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant03","You want to buy something, ask Galar."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant04","No time to chat - sorry!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CoparannKeepGuard01","Keep out, strangers!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CoparannKeepGuard02","The Baron's waiting for you."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaptainIronshell01","Stay in the light, citizens!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyPCSpeech_TowerOfMagicJammedDoor","This door is blocked… magically?"
"Narration/&Banter_Generic_01","Something's off."
"Narration/&Banter_Generic_02","We should search the area carefully."
"Narration/&Banter_Generic_03","Look at this place!"
"Narration/&Banter_Generic_04","Doesn't make any sense…"
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_01","Where did those goblins come from?"
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_02","Some hole in the mountain, I guess."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_03","What's that smell?"
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_04","Damn, it stinks…"
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_05","I wouldn't sleep here."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_06","The Soraks can't be far away."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_07","We need to rest if we want to stand a chance against them."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_08","This place is so dark…"
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_09","That was fun."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_10","That was a long shot."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_11","We were so close."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_01","I can't believe Lisbath stayed behind…"
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_02","We're all gonna die…"
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_03","I'll have to tell the captain's wife."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_01","We should have left long ago…"
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_02","Leadership is what we need now."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_03","They won't get me without a fight."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_01","Up to my knees in the mud, nothing new here."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_02","Shit food, shit shoes, business as usual."
"Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_03","If we survive this I might drink myself to death."
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_01","This place doesn't make any sense."
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_02","In the Badlands… blah, blah…"
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_03","What happens if you fall down there?"
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_04","Wanna try?"
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_05","All these books floating around and I can't grab them."
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_06","Are those webs?"
"Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_01","Welcome, deputies!"
"Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_02","Your rooms are ready."
"Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_03","Good day, senior deputies."
"Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_04","Clear skies… as they say!"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_01","This place is so… wet."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_02","Feels like everything's dead around here…"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_03","Well, it's dark, but at least it's not sewers anymore."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_04","Stay on your guard! We weren't invited here."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_05","What's in all those bottles?"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_06","I wouldn't set them on fire just to find out."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_07","Smells like death."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_08","Is that a… pile of corpses? Gross!"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_09","Someone here doesn't like the light of day."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_10","What kind of castle is that?"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_11","Someone transformed it into a maze."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_12","Someone paranoid, you mean?"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_13","We're going to die here."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_14","There must a way be out."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_15","Look for hints!"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_16","It lost its mana, that's all."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_17","These arrows, they're not just random."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_18","Something's changed here."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_19","That cannot be opened from here."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_20","There must be a mechanism somewhere."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_21","I heard a mechanism."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_22","That opened something."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_23","This guy made it this far… maybe he found a hint."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_24","Another victim of the maze…"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_25","Tell me we're not going back in there…"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_26","So, no rune activated on that teleporter."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_27","I guess we need to reset the teleporter."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_28","I think we took a wrong turn."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_29","Hmm… four slabs for the four of us?"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_30","And… no rune on that teleporter, either."
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_31","I think this slab has triggered something!"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_32","I heard some kind of mechanism!"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_Talbut","Keep away from my home, strangers!"
"Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_Anbgi","Where's that damn femur?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_01","She's crazy…"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_02","Shouldn't we go to Coparann?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_01","My beautiful river… broken and stained…"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_02","The pull, the pull…"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_03","Master, I'm coming!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_04","Are there dwarf kings now? Halfling kings too, maybe?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_05","That sounds… wrong."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_06","No slaves, no Gates…"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_07","…this travel is exhausting."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_08","Humans don't look that bad."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_09","They smell a bit, though…"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_10","This… town is really dirty."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_11","Is this Baron really a dwarf?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_12","I can't call a dwarf my lord, can I?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_13","He's rude. But he is a dwarf, after all."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_14","He is a nice dwarf."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_15","A halfling merchant? I almost didn't see him."
"Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_01","Nice gardens."
"Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_02","This place is magnificent."
"Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_03","I never thought I'd get so close to the embassies."
"Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_04","That's a view!"
"Narration/&LoreTrailer01","Before the Cataclysm, there were no gods on Solasta."
"Narration/&LoreTrailer02","No humans, either."
"Narration/&LoreTrailer03","Then the Rift opened."
"Narration/&LoreTrailer04","Some say it was a magical accident… "
"Narration/&LoreTrailer05","…or the work of an evil god."
"Narration/&LoreTrailer06","No one knows for sure."
"Narration/&LoreTrailer07","The Cataclysm destroyed the old High Elf empire"
"Narration/&LoreTrailer08","- Manacalon, they called it -"
"Narration/&LoreTrailer09","and twisted the land beyond recognition."
"Narration/&LoreTrailer10","Now, only the brave and the foolish go there, in search of ancient treasures."
"Narration/&LoreTrailer11","But something is happening, deep in those Badlands."
"Narration/&LoreTrailer12","Whatever it is,"
"Narration/&LoreTrailer13","it can't be good."
"Narration/&TelemaArrivingTitle","Entering Telema"
"Narration/&Telema_1_Entrance_Fighter","So, these are the ruins of Telema?"
"Narration/&Telema_2_Entrance_Wizard","Just as the chronicles describe them!"
"Narration/&Telema_3_Entrance_Wizard","Imagine the wonders that await us inside!"
"Narration/&Telema_4_Entrance_Cleric","Don't forget… we're here to help the Scavengers."
"Narration/&Telema_5_Entrance_Rogue","And get rich, right?"
"Narration/&Telema_6_Entrance_Rogue","Help the Scavengers and get rich."
"Narration/&Telema_7_Entrance_Fighter","You're all heart, aren't you?"
"Narration/&Telema_8_Entrance_Cleric","That must be their camp over there."
"Narration/&Telema_9_Entrance_Cleric","Come on, let's go."
"Narration/&TelemaMeetingScavsTitle","The Scavengers' Camp"
"Narration/&Telema_10_MeetingScavs_Lena","Who goes there?"
"Narration/&Telema_11_MeetingScavs_Fighter","Friends!"
"Narration/&Telema_12_MeetingScavs_Cleric","Runnel sent us."
"Narration/&Telema_13_MeetingScavs_Dek","Where is he?"
"Narration/&Telema_14_MeetingScavs_Cleric","Resting… he was in pretty bad shape, but he'll be okay."
"Narration/&Telema_15_MeetingScavs_Cleric","He said you need help."
"Narration/&Telema_16_MeetingScavs_Dek","We did. If only you'd come sooner…"
"Narration/&Telema_17_MeetingScavs_Choice","What happened?"
"Narration/&Telema_18_MeetingScavs_Answer","We came as soon as we could. What happened?"
"Narration/&Telema_19_MeetingScavs_Lena","We know… and thanks."
"Narration/&Telema_20_MeetingScavs_Lena","Dek here is upset, that's all."
"Narration/&Telema_21_MeetingScavs_Dek","I can speak for myself, thank you!"
"Narration/&Telema_22_MeetingScavs_Lena","He thinks we should have left with Runnel."
"Narration/&Telema_23_MeetingScavs_Dek","Instead of waiting here for the orcs to kill us?"
"Narration/&Telema_24_MeetingScavs_Dek","Absolutely, I think we should have left!"
"Narration/&Telema_25_MeetingScavs_Choice","We're here now."
"Narration/&Telema_26_MeetingScavs_Answer","Well, we're here now. How can we help?"
"Narration/&Telema_27_MeetingScavs_Lena","Never mind Dek."
"Narration/&Telema_28_MeetingScavs_Lena","He's upset, that's all."
"Narration/&Telema_29_MeetingScavs_Dek","I can speak for myself, thank you!"
"Narration/&Telema_30_MeetingScavs_Lena","He thinks we should have left with Runnel."
"Narration/&Telema_31_MeetingScavs_Dek","Instead of waiting for the orcs to kill us?"
"Narration/&Telema_32_MeetingScavs_Dek","Absolutely, I think we should have left!"
"Narration/&Telema_33_MeetingScavs_Choice","We could go back."
"Narration/&Telema_34_MeetingScavs_Answer","Well, if we're too late, maybe we should just go back."
"Narration/&Telema_35_MeetingScavs_Dek","Yes, well, maybe you should!"
"Narration/&Telema_36_MeetingScavs_Lena","Never mind Dek."
"Narration/&Telema_37_MeetingScavs_Lena","He's upset, that's all."
"Narration/&Telema_38_MeetingScavs_Dek","Upset? Why should I be upset? We're just waiting to die, that's all!"
"Narration/&Telema_39_MeetingScavs_Lena","We can't leave Hector in there."
"Narration/&Telema_40_MeetingScavs_Dek","He's dead, Lena… dead! It's too late!"
"Narration/&Telema_41_MeetingScavs_Lena","You don't know that!"
"Narration/&Telema_42_MeetingScavs_Choice","Calm down."
"Narration/&Telema_43_MeetingScavs_Answer","Calm down, now. This won't help."
"Narration/&Telema_44_MeetingScavs_Choice","We'll help you."
"Narration/&Telema_45_MeetingScavs_Answer","It's all right… we're here to help you."
"Narration/&Telema_46_MeetingScavs_Choice","Amazing."
"Narration/&Telema_47_MeetingScavs_Answer","Why don't you just kill each other and save the orcs the trouble?"
"Narration/&Telema_48_MeetingScavs_Rogue","What's our help worth to you, anyway?"
"Narration/&Telema_49_MeetingScavs_Fighter","Stop it!"
"Narration/&Telema_50_MeetingScavs_Lena","All right."
"Narration/&Telema_51_MeetingScavs_Lena","What did Runnel tell you?"
"Narration/&Telema_52_MeetingScavs_Fighter","Just that his team needed help… nothing else."
"Narration/&Telema_53_MeetingScavs_Lena","We were scavenging in the ruins, and -"
"Narration/&Telema_54_MeetingScavs_Dek","Orcs! There's a whole tribe in there!"
"Narration/&Telema_55_MeetingScavs_Lena","It was just a raiding party."
"Narration/&Telema_56_MeetingScavs_Lena","We fought them off… "
"Narration/&Telema_57_MeetingScavs_Lena","…but they killed some of our people and dragged Hector off."
"Narration/&Telema_58_MeetingScavs_Dek","And we've just been waiting here for them to come and finish the job."
"Narration/&Telema_59_MeetingScavs_Fighter","They haven't done that yet, though."
"Narration/&Telema_60_MeetingScavs_Rogue","Well, you're right about your friend… "
"Narration/&Telema_61_MeetingScavs_Rogue","…he must be dead by now."
"Narration/&Telema_62_MeetingScavs_Cleric","We don't know that. There is always hope."
"Narration/&Telema_63_MeetingScavs_Rogue","Hope? Those orcs had him for dinner the first night."
"Narration/&Telema_64_MeetingScavs_Wizard","I don't know… they took him alive, after all…"
"Narration/&Telema_65_MeetingScavs_Rogue","So they wanted to keep him fresh… orcs are orcs!"
"Narration/&Telema_66_MeetingScavs_Fighter","Ignore them. So, we just need to go in and find Hector?"
"Narration/&Telema_67_MeetingScavs_Dek","Yeah… good luck with that!"
"Narration/&Telema_68_MeetingScavs_Cleric","Why is he so angry?"
"Narration/&Telema_69_MeetingScavs_Lena","He and Hector don't exactly get along."
"Narration/&Telema_70_MeetingScavs_Lena","But he's one of our crew… "
"Narration/&Telema_71_MeetingScavs_Lena","…and I won't leave anyone behind."
"Narration/&Telema_72_MeetingScavs_Cleric","We gave our word to your leaders."
"Narration/&Telema_73_MeetingScavs_Cleric","We will get Hector back."
"Narration/&Telema_74_MeetingScavs_Lena","Thanks."
"Narration/&Telema_75_MeetingScavs_Lena","Do you need food?"
"Narration/&Telema_76_MeetingScavs_Fighter","You think we'll be away for that long?"
"Narration/&Telema_77_MeetingScavs_Lena","You can never be too careful… "
"Narration/&Telema_78_MeetingScavs_Lena","…that's the law of the Badlands."
"Narration/&Telema_79_MeetingScavs_Lena","We can spare some if you need it."
"Narration/&Telema_80_MeetingScavs_Lena","We have more than we need for just the two of us."
"Narration/&Telema_81_MeetingScavs_Dek","Are you serious?"
"Narration/&Telema_82_MeetingScavs_Dek","You're giving away our food?"
"Narration/&Telema_83_MeetingScavs_Lena","They're risking their lives for us, Dek."
"Narration/&Telema_84_MeetingScavs_Dek","For Hector. We can starve, apparently."
"Narration/&Telema_85_MeetingScavs_ChoiceIntimidate","The rescuers get the food."
"Narration/&Telema_86_MeetingScavs_AnswerIntimidate","The rescuers get the food."
"Narration/&Telema_87_MeetingScavs_Fighter","Get it?"
"Narration/&Telema_88_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","I don't believe it."
"Narration/&Telema_89_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","That's on you, Lena."
"Narration/&Telema_90_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess","Don't worry,"

"Narration/&Telema_98_MeetingScavs_Lena","And good luck!"
"Narration/&Telema_99_MeetingScavs_ChoicePersuasion","You're right… keep your food."
"Narration/&Telema_100_MeetingScavs_AnswerPersuasion","You're right… keep it. We'll survive."
"Narration/&Telema_101_MeetingScavs_Cleric","We'll be back in no time."
"Narration/&Telema_102_MeetingScavs_Cleric","If not, you'll have enough to eat."
"Narration/&Telema_103_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","Don't look at me."
"Narration/&Telema_104_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess","Just one day of food, Dek."
"Narration/&Telema_105_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","All right, take the damn food!"
"Narration/&Telema_106_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","Thank you!"
"Narration/&Telema_107_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed","Absolutely."
"Narration/&Telema_108_MeetingScavs_Choice","Your boss said you'd feed us."
"Narration/&Telema_109_MeetingScavs_Answer","Your boss said we could take whatever resources we needed."
"Narration/&Telema_110_MeetingScavs_Dek","Did he?"
"Narration/&Telema_111_MeetingScavs_Rogue","Are you calling me a liar?"
"Narration/&Telema_112_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","No."
"Narration/&Telema_113_MeetingScavs_Deceptionchecksuccess","So?"
"Narration/&Telema_114_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","So take the damn food!"
"Narration/&Telema_115_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed","Why not?"
"Narration/&Telema_116_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed","Fair enough."
"Narration/&Telema_117_MeetingScavs_Wizardcheckfailed","Impressive negotiation skills."

"Narration/&TelemaBasReliefTitle","A Sight for Sore Eyes"
"Narration/&Telema_119_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard","Look at that!"
"Narration/&Telema_120_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard","Perfectly preserved!"
"Narration/&Telema_121_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric","What is it?"
"Narration/&Telema_122_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard","It's a scene from the Imperial conquest of the northern provinces."
"Narration/&Telema_123_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric","When the Empire ruled the lands of the Snow Alliance."
"Narration/&Telema_124_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric","I can't pretend to feel nostalgic about those times."
"Narration/&Telema_125_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard","Nostalgic? That was more than a thousand years ago!"
"Narration/&Telema_126_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric","The Old Empire was built on slavery and racism."
"Narration/&Telema_127_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue","Thanks for the (yawn) history lesson."
"Narration/&Telema_128_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue","Now… does this look valuable to you?"
"Narration/&Telema_129_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard","All history is valuable, my friend."
"Narration/&Telema_130_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue","Tell that to my purse."
"Narration/&Telema_131_Room01_BasRelief_Fighter","Anyway, this doesn't help Hector, so let's move out."
"Narration/&TelemaChestTitle","Too Good to Be True"
"Narration/&Telema_132_Room01_Chest_Fighter","Well, that's interesting."
"Narration/&Telema_133_Room01_Chest_Rogue","You don't say! Look at that!"
"Narration/&Telema_134_Room01_Chest_Fighter","I'd be careful if I were you."
"Narration/&Telema_135_Room01_Chest_Fighter","It looks too good to be true."
"Narration/&Telema_136_Room01_Chest_Rogue","That's right. You can't be too careful… "
"Narration/&Telema_137_Room01_Chest_Rogue","…that's the law of the Badlands."
"Narration/&TelemaStatueTitle","Memory of the Past"
"Narration/&Telema_138_Room01_Statue_Rogue","Try not to stare… you're making that statue uncomfortable."
"Narration/&Telema_139_Room01_Statue_Wizard","But it's… can you read this?"
"Narration/&Telema_140_Room01_Statue_Rogue","Never had the benefit of an Imperial indoctrin… I mean, education."
"Narration/&Telema_141_Room01_Statue_Cleric","That's Emperor Gildean the Third."
"Narration/&Telema_142_Room01_Statue_Rogue","How do you know?"
"Narration/&Telema_143_Room01_Statue_Cleric","It's written here."
"Narration/&Telema_144_Room01_Statue_Cleric","For those who can read it."
"Narration/&Telema_145_Room01_Statue_Rogue","That's nice for you, I'm sure."
"Narration/&Telema_146_Room01_Statue_Wizard","His was a very ancient dynasty."
"Narration/&Telema_147_Room01_Statue_Wizard","Look at his date of birth."
"Narration/&Telema_148_Room01_Statue_Cleric","And location."
"Narration/&Telema_149_Room01_Statue_Wizard","Wait! I must copy this."
"Narration/&Telema_150_Room01_Statue_Wizard","The Tower will find this interesting."
"Narration/&Telema_151_Room01_Statue_Fighter","Are you done?"
"Narration/&TelemaDoorTitle","Dead End?"
"Narration/&Telema_152_Room01_Door_Rogue","Can we open it?"
"Narration/&Telema_153_Room01_Door_Fighter","I don't see how."
"Narration/&Telema_154_Room01_Door_Wizard","Must be magically sealed."
"Narration/&Telema_155_Room01_Door_Cleric","Do you think a magic seal from Imperial times would still work?"
"Narration/&Telema_156_Room01_Door_Fighter","In the Badlands, anything's possible."
"Narration/&Telema_157_Room01_Door_Rogue","Do you have a spell to open it?"
"Narration/&Telema_158_Room01_Door_Wizard","No."
"Narration/&Telema_159_Room01_Door_Fighter","Let's not waste time, then. Move out!"
"Narration/&Telema_160_Room01_Crawl_Rogue","They must have gone through here after they took Hector."
"Narration/&Telema_161_Room01_Crawl_Cleric","Really? We need to crawl through there?"
"Narration/&Telema_162_Room01_Crawl_Rogue","Yeah, but you don't mind being on your knees, do you?"
"Narration/&Telema_163_Room01_Crawl_Cleric","Very funny."
"Narration/&Telema_164_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter","I see light ahead!"
"Narration/&Telema_165_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue","Let me take a look before you go clanking around in your armor."
"Narration/&Telema_166_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter","Be careful!"
"Narration/&Telema_167_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue","Law of the Badlands, my friend."
"Narration/&TelemaBackFromReconTitle","Meeting the Locals"
"Narration/&Telema_168_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue","The orcs are here."
"Narration/&Telema_169_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue","Looks like we can sneak around."
"Narration/&Telema_170_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter","Even me?"
"Narration/&Telema_171_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue","Ehh… probably."
"Narration/&Telema_172_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric","Did you see Hector?"
"Narration/&Telema_173_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue","Not a trace."
"Narration/&Telema_174_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter","We should attack… we have the element of surprise."
"Narration/&Telema_175_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric","But what if Hector's down there too?"
"Narration/&Telema_176_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Wizard","I hear some orc tribes can be bartered with."
"Narration/&Telema_177_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue","Not these orcs."
"Narration/&TelemaOrcCampExitTitle","Disappointment…"
"Narration/&Telema_178_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter","So, no Hector?"
"Narration/&Telema_179_OrcCamp_exit_Wizard","It doesn't make any sense."
"Narration/&Telema_180_OrcCamp_exit_Cleric","Maybe he's farther down."
"Narration/&Telema_181_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter","All right, let's keep looking."
"Narration/&TelemaVerticalEntranceTitle","Lighting the Darkness"
"Narration/&Telema_182_Vertical_entrance_Fighter","I don't like this."
"Narration/&Telema_183_Vertical_entrance_Rogue","We can climb down."
"Narration/&Telema_184_Vertical_entrance_Wizard","It's too dark."
"Narration/&Telema_185_Vertical_entrance_Cleric","Too unstable, too. These blocks look like they could fall at any minute."
"Narration/&Telema_186_Vertical_entrance_Wizard","There's some kind of black oil dripping from the ceiling."
"Narration/&Telema_187_Vertical_entrance_Wizard","Maybe we can use it to light up the place."
"Narration/&TelemaVerticalExitTitle","No Way Back"
"Narration/&Telema_188_Vertical_exit_Rogue","Damn it! Now we're stuck!"
"Narration/&Telema_189_Vertical_exit_Fighter","Do you think the orcs would bring Hector farther in than this?"
"Narration/&Telema_190_Vertical_exit_Wizard","Not the orcs, no… "
"Narration/&Telema_191_Vertical_exit_Wizard","…but something else… maybe."
"Narration/&Telema_192_Vertical_exit_Fighter","We've come this far… let's find him."
"Narration/&Telema_193_Vertical_exit_Rogue","I'm starting to think we might need that food after all."
"Narration/&TelemaShaftEntranceTitle","Unexpected Denizens"
"Narration/&Telema_194_Shaft_entrance_Cleric","What is this… an amphitheater?"
"Narration/&Telema_195_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","A very special one."
"Narration/&Telema_196_Shaft_entrance_Rogue","Not room for much of a crowd…"
"Narration/&Telema_197_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","Students of magic. The Masters taught spells here."
"Narration/&Telema_198_Shaft_entrance_Fighter","Do spiders like magic shows?"
"Narration/&Telema_199_Shaft_entrance_Fighter","Because I see a lot of webs."
"Narration/&Telema_200_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","Deep spiders. We will have to be careful."
"Narration/&Telema_201_Shaft_entrance_Fighter","Deep Spiders?"
"Narration/&Telema_202_Shaft_entrance_Cleric","Very large and aggressive, but sensitive to light."
"Narration/&Telema_203_Shaft_entrance_Rogue","Just how large is very large?"
"Narration/&Telema_204_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","Just keep your lights ready…"
"Narration/&Telema_205_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","…and your oil handy."
"Narration/&Telema_206_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","The more light we have, the fewer spiders we'll face."
"Narration/&Telema_207_Shaft_entrance_Fighter","We don't have a choice here. The only way out is up."
"Narration/&TelemaShaftUpperTitle","A Way Out?"
"Narration/&Telema_208_Shaft_upper_Fighter","How many are there?"
"Narration/&Telema_209_Shaft_upper_Rogue","You don't want to know."
"Narration/&Telema_210_Shaft_upper_Cleric","Try pushing this down!"
"Narration/&Telema_211_Shaft_upper_Cleric","I feel a weakness here."
"Narration/&TelemaShaftCollapsedTitle","Escape… to Hector!"
"Narration/&Telema_212_Shaft_collapsed_Wizard","Well done!"
"Narration/&Telema_213_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue","You sure they're dead?"
"Narration/&Telema_214_Shaft_collapsed_Fighter","Well, they're not coming back."
"Narration/&Telema_215_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue","Good."
"Narration/&Telema_216_Shaft_collapsed_Cleric","My friends, I believe I have found Hector."
"Narration/&Telema_217_Rescue_Hector","By all the gods at once… thank you!"
"Narration/&Telema_218_Rescue_Fighter","Are you Hector?"
"Narration/&Telema_219_Rescue_Hector","Yes! And you?"
"Narration/&Telema_220_Rescue_Fighter","The boss sent us. Runnel went for help."
"Narration/&Telema_221_Rescue_Hector","Runnel! So he survived?"
"Narration/&Telema_222_Rescue_Cleric","Barely, but yes."
"Narration/&Telema_223_Rescue_Cleric","He's safely back in town."
"Narration/&Telema_224_Rescue_Rogue","So, did the spiders take you?"
"Narration/&Telema_225_Rescue_Hector","The orcs did, after their raid."
"Narration/&Telema_226_Rescue_Hector","They kept me for a while."
"Narration/&Telema_227_Rescue_Hector","I was wondering why."
"Narration/&Telema_228_Rescue_Hector","I finally got the answer when they… "
"Narration/&Telema_229_Rescue_Hector","…well, they sacrificed me."
"Narration/&Telema_230_Rescue_Fighter","What?"
"Narration/&Telema_231_Rescue_Hector","They feed the spiders. So they don't get eaten themselves."
"Narration/&Telema_232_Rescue_Hector","They leave captives at the top of the amphitheater."
"Narration/&Telema_233_Rescue_Rogue","Oh, that one?"
"Narration/&Telema_234_Rescue_Rogue","We kind of… destroyed it."
"Narration/&Telema_235_Rescue_Fighter","The spider nest, too."
"Narration/&Telema_236_Rescue_Hector","Interesting."
"Narration/&Telema_237_Rescue_Hector","I'm not sure how the orcs will react to that."
"Narration/&Telema_238_Rescue_Hector","This spider cult seemed important to them."
"Narration/&Telema_239_Rescue_Fighter","Can't say I feel sorry for them."
"Narration/&Telema_240_Rescue_Hector","I owe you my life. Thanks again."
"Narration/&Telema_241_Rescue_Cleric","You are most welcome."
"Narration/&Telema_242_Rescue_Fighter","You should rest, and I think we should do the same."
"Narration/&Telema_243_Rescue_Hector","Good idea."
"Narration/&Telema_244_Rescue_Choice","What's your story?"
"Narration/&Telema_245_Rescue_Answer","So Hector, what's your story?"
"Narration/&Telema_246_Rescue_Hector","Me? I'm just another Scavenger, really."
"Narration/&Telema_247_Rescue_Hector","I make a living bringing old stuff out of the Badlands."
"Narration/&Telema_248_Rescue_Choice","What about Lena and Dek?"
"Narration/&Telema_249_Rescue_Answer","Do you know Lena and Dek? They seem like quite a pair!"
"Narration/&Telema_250_Rescue_Hector","Oh, those two… always fighting over something."
"Narration/&Telema_251_Rescue_Hector","But you couldn't separate them if you wanted to."
"Narration/&Telema_252_Rescue_Fighter","They seemed pretty much at each other's throats."
"Narration/&Telema_253_Rescue_Hector","Yeah, like I said… always fighting."
"Narration/&Telema_254_Rescue_Hector","But in battle, always back to back."
"Narration/&Telema_255_Rescue_Rogue","Aww… that's so sweet."
"Narration/&Telema_256_Rescue_Choice","Did you find anything good in here?"
"Narration/&Telema_257_Rescue_Answer","Did you find anything good in the ruins?"
"Narration/&Telema_258_Rescue_Hector","No, not much. You've seen the state of the place… "
"Narration/&Telema_259_Rescue_Hector","…but there was something."
"Narration/&Telema_260_Rescue_Hector","Didn't have time to use it."
"Narration/&Telema_261_Rescue_Fighter","What is it?"
"Narration/&Telema_262_Rescue_Rogue","A key?"
"Narration/&Telema_263_Rescue_Hector","I think it opens the door in the ruins."
"Narration/&Telema_264_Rescue_Rogue","Oh, yeah… that door."
"Narration/&Telema_265_Rescue_Hector","At least, I hope it does."
"Narration/&Telema_266_Rescue_Hector","Not much else, though. I think the orcs got it all."
"Narration/&Telema_267_Rescue_Choice","You're a cleric of Einar?"
"Narration/&Telema_268_Rescue_Answer","You're wearing the flaming sword."
"Narration/&Telema_269_Rescue_Hector","And I can see you're from the Order of the Beacon."
"Narration/&Telema_270_Rescue_Cleric","Are you a priest, Hector?"
"Narration/&Telema_271_Rescue_Hector","Just a humble follower."
"Narration/&Telema_272_Rescue_Hector","This was given to me by one of your brothers."
"Narration/&Telema_273_Rescue_Hector","We fought together… he felt like he owed me."
"Narration/&Telema_274_Rescue_Hector","And he gave me this."
"Narration/&Telema_275_After_Rest_Fighter","I think we're all ready to go."
"Narration/&Telema_276_After_Rest_Wizard","Indeed."
"Narration/&Telema_277_After_Rest_Cleric","I think we're close to the surface."
"Narration/&Telema_278_After_Rest_Cleric","I can feel it."
"Narration/&Telema_279_After_Rest_Fighter","All right… let's move."
"Narration/&Telema_280_Ambush_Fighter","Orcs! Over there!"
"Narration/&Telema_281_Ambush_Rogue","It's an ambush!"
"Narration/&Telema_282_Ambush_Fighter","Time to fight!"
"Narration/&Telema_283_WayBack_Fighter","Hey! Take a look at this."
"Narration/&Telema_284_WayBack_Cleric","The stone is carved."
"Narration/&Telema_285_WayBack_Fighter","Are we back near the ruins?"
"Narration/&Telema_286_WayBack_Cleric","It looks fragile, let's try pushing it."
"Narration/&Telema_287_WayBack_Fighter","Well done… we're back in the ruins!"
"Narration/&Telema_288_WayBack_Rogue","So, do you still have that key?"
"Narration/&Telema_289_WayBack_Hector","Sure."
"Narration/&Telema_290_WayBack_Hector","Take it."
"Narration/&Telema_291_Magic_Door_Wizard","Amazing!"
"Narration/&Telema_292_Magic_Door_Wizard","This room hasn't been opened in a millennium!"
"Narration/&Telema_293_Magic_Door_Cleric","Those books are falling to pieces."
"Narration/&Telema_294_Magic_Door_Wizard","Not this one!"
"Narration/&Telema_295_Magic_Door_Cleric","Look around for other valuables."
"Narration/&Telema_296_Magic_Door_Rogue","Already doing it!"
"Narration/&Telema_297_Exit_Temple_Lena","Hey! Here they are!"
"Narration/&Telema_298_Exit_Temple_Dek","I'll be damned… they're alive!"
"Narration/&Telema_299_Exit_Temple_Fighter","We told you we'd find him."
"Narration/&Telema_300_Exit_Temple_Lena","Hector?"
"Narration/&Telema_301_Exit_Temple_Dek","Lena, wait!"
"Narration/&Telema_302_Exit_Temple_Cleric","What's going on?"
"Narration/&Telema_303_Exit_Temple_Lena","That's not Hector!"
"Narration/&Telema_304_Exit_Temple_Fighter","What?"
"Narration/&Telema_305_Exit_Temple_Rogue","Then just who are you, friend?"
"Narration/&Telema_306_Exit_Temple_Hector","Put down your weapons."
"Narration/&Telema_307_Exit_Temple_Fighter","Why would we do that?"
"Narration/&Tavern_01_1_Stealth_Normal","This beer tastes like donkey piss. Not that I'm complaining."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_2_Explorer_Default","Hope I'm not too late."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_3_Explorer_Normal","Ran into a bit of trouble on the way here."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_4_Spellcaster_Normal","Take the load off. There's plenty of donkey piss to go around. "
"Narration/&Tavern_01_5_Spellcaster_Formal","Sit. Relax. Perhaps you'd enjoy a pint of this obnoxious ale?"
"Narration/&Tavern_01_6_Fighter_Default","Here for the Council job? Join the club. "
"Narration/&Tavern_01_7_Fighter_Authoritative","If you're here for the Council job, get in line."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_8_Fighter_Friendly","You're not too late, friend. We're all here for the same reason. "
"Narration/&Tavern_01_9_Fighter_Default","Apparently, Lord Carran likes to keep people waiting."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_10_Fighter_Authoritative","Though if this Lord Carran doesn't show up soon, I may go looking for him."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_11_Fighter_Friendly","Grab a chair. "
"Narration/&Tavern_01_12_Stealth_Default","Another round, barkeeper. Four of your finest flagons of donkey piss, please!"
"Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Default","Looks like you've been waiting here a while."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Formal","I see you're all making the best of this."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Slang","So is this the job? Getting shitfaced?"
"Narration/&Tavern_01_14_Spellcaster_Normal","We do what we have to. So what's this trouble you were telling us about?"
"Narration/&Tavern_01_15_Spellcaster_Formal","Indeed. You mentioned something about some trouble. Would you care to elaborate?"
"Narration/&Tavern_01_16_Explorer_Normal","Well, I was making my way here… "
"Narration/&Tavern_01_17_Explorer_Normal","…when three bandits leapt out of the bushes with crossbows. "
"Narration/&Tavern_01_18_Explorer_Normal","They dragged me off to some decrepit prison… "
"Narration/&Tavern_01_19_Explorer_Normal","…and tossed me in a filthy cell that smelled of rat piss."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_20_Explorer_Slang","Well, I was heading down a lonely road… "
"Narration/&Tavern_01_21_Explorer_Slang","…when three shitheads jumped from the bushes, dragged me off… "
"Narration/&Tavern_01_22_Explorer_Slang","…and threw my ass in this rundown jail."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_23_Explorer_Slang","Smelled like some poor bastard had died in there."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_24_Explorer_Formal","I was heading down the highway, minding my own business…"
"Narration/&Tavern_01_25_Explorer_Formal","…when three brigands burst out of the bushes and waylaid me."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_26_Explorer_Formal","They carried me off to some ramshackle prison."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_27_Explorer_Formal","An Imperial ruin of some sort… "
"Narration/&Tavern_01_28_Explorer_Formal","Fortunately, the walls were as weak as this mediocre ale we're drinking."
"Narration/&Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Normal","…Don't know what was holding the place up… "
"Narration/&Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Slang","…a strong wind coulda taken it down."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_1_Fighter_Normal","Nice move, that trick with the wall. Glad you're no worse for wear."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_2_Fighter_Formal","So you escaped unscathed. Well done, my friend!"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_3_Explorer_Normal","My flagon is empty of ale, and Lord Carran still isn't here."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_4_Explorer_Cynical","Perhaps someone else can tell a story since it looks like we might be here a while. "
"Narration/&Tavern_02_5_Explorer_Lawful","This Council needs to get organized. They have no right to keep us waiting like this. "
"Narration/&Tavern_02_6_Spellcaster_Normal","Have another ale. It's not like you have anywhere better to be."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_7_Spellcaster_Greedy","I don't mind waiting as long as they pay us for our darned time. "
"Narration/&Tavern_02_8_Spellcaster_Aristocrat","The Council is likely busy with important matters of state, and we are not, so have patience."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_9_Spellcaster_Lowlife","You think the Council cares about the likes of us? They'll get to us when they're good and ready."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_10_Fighter_Normal","Well, let me tell you my story then. I, too, was accosted on the way here, but I faced my foes head on. "
"Narration/&Tavern_02_11_Fighter_Violent","I have a tale to tell as well. I, too, was attacked, but I put an end to my enemies with blood and pain."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_12_Stealth_Slang","So what are you waiting for? Spit it out, why don't you?"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_13_Stealth_Normal","Let's hear it, then. Don't be shy."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_14_Stealth_Formal","Proceed, then. Everyone enjoys a tale well told."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_15_Merton_Default","What a bunch namby-pambies! You're lucky you weren't attacked by Soraks!"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_16_Fighter_Normal","I don't remember anyone asking your opinion."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_17_Fighter_Violent","Shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for ya!"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_18_Fighter_Friendly","That's right, buddy. It's always good to be lucky."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_19_Merton_Default","The Badlands are thick with 'em. Shapeshifting bastards!"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_20_Stealth_Normal","Never mind him. He's just another drunk Scavenger."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_21_Stealth_Cynical","Everyone's a critic."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_22_Stealth_Einar","I'm so tired of stupid drunks ranting about mythical creatures."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_23_Explorer_Default","Aren't all drunks basically stupid?"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_24_Spellcaster_Default","Soraks might be legend, but orcs are quite real, and not just in the Badlands."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_25_Spellcaster_Default","…I stumbled across a secret settlement right here in the Principality."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_26_Fighter_Normal","What?"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_27_Fighter_Slang","Bullshit!"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_28_Fighter_Formal","That is preposterous."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_29_Spellcaster_Normal","High in the hills, two days west of here."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_30_Spellcaster_Normal","I left the main road to find a shorter way through… "
"Narration/&Tavern_02_31_Spellcaster_Normal","And I was making good time… "
"Narration/&Tavern_02_32_Spellcaster_Normal","…when I dropped through a frickin' sinkhole into a cave."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_33_Spellcaster_Slang","I was dragging my weary ass up the hills west of here… "
"Narration/&Tavern_02_34_Spellcaster_Slang","…and decided to leave the road to look for a shortcut."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_35_Spellcaster_Slang","It was beautiful day. Blue skies. Birds singing. I watched one take wing… "
"Narration/&Tavern_02_36_Spellcaster_Slang","…and fell right into a blasted hole."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_37_Spellcaster_Formal","I traveled here from the east, and left the main highway… "
"Narration/&Tavern_02_38_Spellcaster_Formal","…hoping to save time by traversing the hills."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_39_Spellcaster_Formal","The views were magnificent, but I should have kept my eye on the path."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_40_Spellcaster_Formal","Because it gave way beneath my feet, plunging me into gloomy darkness. "
"Narration/&Tavern_03_1_Fighter_Selfpres","Not sure I would have slept so close to a horde of orcs."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_2_Fighter_Violence","I would have slaughtered every one of those green-skinned monsters."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_3_Fighter_Cynical","You slept with a bunch of orcs? That explains the smell."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_4_Spellcaster_Default","Orcs have a very distinctive stink."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_5_Stealth_Cynical","I'm beginning to think Lord Carran might be a mythical creature. "
"Narration/&Tavern_03_6_Stealth_Violence","If Lord Carran keeps us waiting much longer, I might greet him with a dagger."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_7_Stealth_Lawful","We should bill the Council for all this wasted time."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_8_Explorer_Default","We've all told a tale of our travels here. All but one of us."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_9_Stealth_Default","Yes, but I have a good reason for that. It's none of your damn business."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_10_Fighter_Slang","Come on, now. Don't be a killjoy. We all sang for our supper. Now it's your turn!"
"Narration/&Tavern_03_11_Fighter_Formal","We can't take up arms together if we don't trust each other. "
"Narration/&Tavern_03_12_Fighter_Normal","You can't have a true friendship without trust. What are you hiding?"
"Narration/&Tavern_03_13_Stealth_Default","Fine - you want to know the truth?"
"Narration/&Tavern_03_14_Stealth_Default","I stopped on the way here to visit an old friend of mine… "
"Narration/&Tavern_03_15_Stealth_Default","And discovered he was up to his eyeballs in debt with a loan shark."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_16_Explorer_Normal","Oh, that's not good."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_17_Explorer_Slang","Sounds like an idiot."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_18_Explorer_Formal","So he was in dire straits?"
"Narration/&Tavern_03_19_Stealth_Default","Indeed. He put up a family heirloom as collateral and wanted me to reacquire it."
"Narration/&Tavern_03_20_Stealth_Default","Because, you see, I can be quite stealthy when necessary. "
"Narration/&Tavern_041_Carran_NPC","Are you four here to see Lord Carran?"
"Narration/&Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical_WRITTEN","We're not here to get drunk."
"Narration/&Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","Who's asking?"
"Narration/&Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence_WRITTEN","Maybe we're here looking for a fight."
"Narration/&Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical","Well, we're not here to drink ourselves to death."
"Narration/&Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic","Depends on who's asking."
"Narration/&Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence","Maybe. Or maybe we're here just to raise hell and break heads."
"Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_cynical_NPC","Well, thank you for making that clear…"
"Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_violent_NPC","A fight, is it? I'm sure we can find an outlet for your… enthusiasm."
"Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_NPC","Well, if you are here for Lord Carran of the Legacy Council, that would be me."
"Narration/&Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical_WRITTEN","So you're real, then?"
"Narration/&Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful_WRITTEN","We're ready."
"Narration/&Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy_WRITTEN","We should get paid for waiting."
"Narration/&Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical","So you're not a mythical creature after all."
"Narration/&Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful","Then we are here at your service, sir."
"Narration/&Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy","Fine. I'd like to present you with a bill for the time we just spent cooling our heels."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Cynical","Unlike, say, a sober adventurer?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Lawful","Very good."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Greedy","Feel free. The Council's bursary enjoys a good laugh."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Formal","Might we ask a bit more about this quest of yours, sir, if you please?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Normal","Can you tell us more about the job?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Slang","We kinda need a little bit more info 'bout the job, milord."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_02_Carran_NPC","Well, I suppose it's better if you know what you're doing. "
"Narration/&Tavern_049_03_Carran_NPC","What do you want to know?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_WRITTEN","About the Legacy Council."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_WRITTEN","About the Principality."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_WRITTEN","Are you our employer?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_WRITTEN","We're good, thank you."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_Audio","We should be going, don't you think?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Choice","What can you tell us about this place, the Principality?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran01","We don't exactly have the time…"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran02","…anyway. The Principality of Masgarth is ruled by Princess Ceiwad Silverflower."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran03","We are a wealthy state, with fertile lands, and the easiest access to the Badlands…"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran04","…through a pass called the Copperhead Road."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran05","We're in the capital, Caer Cyflen, which was once part of the ancient Manacalon Empire of the high elves."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran06","Hence the magnificent elvish buildings up there in the high town."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran07","While we don't have a state religion, all of the major faiths on Solasta are represented here…"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran08","…though we tend to favor Einar, the god of valor and fidelity."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Choice","Are we going to work for you?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran01","Not exactly, no. I'll be your contact with the Legacy Council, which you will serve as deputies."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran02","That's why we need to go there and get you sworn in."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Choice","We hear this is a mission for the Council, but what is it, exactly?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01","Dear Maraike! You don't know?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02","I'll try to make it simple, but you know - politics…"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03","The Council includes representatives of the most powerful and influential organizations in the Eastern Kingdoms."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04","It was created to lead a joint effort to explore the Badlands."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_WRITTEN","What are the Badlands?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Choice","What are the Badlands, really?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran01","Simply put, they are a monster-ridden, chaotic wasteland that used to be the elven empire called Manacalon."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran02","It was destroyed about a thousand years ago by the great Cataclysm."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran03","Now, only ruins remain, full of forgotten knowledge, riches, and dangers."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_WRITTEN","What are the Eastern Kingdoms?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Choice","Which countries make up these Eastern Kingdoms?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran01","Simple. The Principality of Masgarth, here, is in the center."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran02","The Snow Alliance lies to the north."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran03","The Kingdom of Gallivan, to the east."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran04","And the New Empire, to the south."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran05","All friendly, more or less, but the peace is fragile."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_WRITTEN","What organizations are there?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Choice","What are the organizations you mentioned?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran01","The Council is… how to put it? A non-governmental organization."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran02","Meaning that state governments are not represented, to avoid partisanship."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran03","Instead, there are delegates from the Guild of Antiquarians, the Tower of Knowledge, the Arcaneum, and the Circle of Danantar."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran04","And the Church of Einar guarantees fairness, led by Marshal Beric Sunblaze and Oathkeeper Leira Kean."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_WRITTEN","We know enough."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_Choice","I think we know enough now. Thank you!"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_Additional_Carran_NPC","Very well."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_NPC","Come! Gather your things. You're late for your swearing in."
"Narration/&Tavern_0410_Stealth_Lawful","Whose fault is that? "
"Narration/&Tavern_0411_Stealth_Cynical","Hurry up and wait. The story of my life."
"Narration/&Tavern_0412_Stealth_Academic","I, for one, am very curious to see the inside of that Council room."
"Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_FindTools","Liam… always thoughtful."
"Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_Liam_01","There you are, you filthy crook!"
"Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark","You? What…? You're drunk! Get out of here before I kill you!"
"Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_Liam_02","Think you scare me? Not anymore!"
"Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark2","A grave mistake."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Normal","Ow! I must have fallen on my wrong side… "
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Formal","Ow! That's going to leave a mark."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Slang","Damn! That hurt like hell."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_nosy","Orcs, here? Strange. I wonder what this totem means."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_lukewarm","Just my luck, falling right into an orc hideout!"
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_wisecracker","Orcs? Of course, that explains the smell… "
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_highclass","My word, this is an orc hideout! The malodor is unmistakable."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_preachy","Orcs? Clearly I'm being punished for leaving the road. Now to seek redemption."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_judgmental","Orcs, here? I must report this… which means, I must get out of here alive."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_mean","Damn me, like I needed to fall into an orc shithole!"
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_logical","An orc hideout right in the middle of the Principality… how surprising. Let's hope they've eaten recently."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_normal","What the… ? Whatever this is, it's not good."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_formal","What a peculiar style of art… clearly the work of some savage hand."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_slang","Charming, that. Just as long as my head doesn't end up on the top."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs","There they are… "
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_normal","…if they see me, I'm dead."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_formal","…discretion is clearly the better part of valor in this instance."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_slang","…head down, or I'm next on the menu."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_normal","What's worse, it looks like this is the only way out."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_formal","No other means of egress is apparent."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_slang","They're camped right by the only exit? It just keeps getting better!"
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_normal","I just need to be patient. They can't stay there forever."
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_formal","Fine, then, I shall wait until they go. These creatures do hunt, right?"
"Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_slang","Guess I'm waiting them out. At least these rocks are… damned uncomfortable."
"Narration/&Council_00_1_Wow_Default","Look at this size of this Council hall!"
"Narration/&Council_00_2_Wow_Default","A very impressive edifice indeed."
"Narration/&Council_00_3_joker_Default","So this is what they spend our taxes on."
"Narration/&Council_00_4_Any_Default","Look! Is that… "
"Narration/&Council_00_5_Any_Default","The Princess!"
"Narration/&Council_00_6_Any_Default","Wait… is she leaving?"
"Narration/&Council_00_7_joker_Default","Apparently so… "
"Narration/&Council_00_8_Any_Default","Then who will administer the oath?"
"Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Default_WRITTEN","The maid who empties her chamber pot?"
"Narration/&Council_00_9_mean_Default_WRITTEN","We're too low for her."
"Narration/&Council_00_9_anyother_Default_WRITTEN","It's not her role."
"Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Default","The maid who empties her chamber pot? No, we're not as important as that. Perhaps her stable boy."
"Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Slang","A lady like her wants nothing to do with drudges like us."
"Narration/&Council_00_9_anyother_Default_Choice","There's an Oathkeeper for that, I think."
"Narration/&Council_00_10_Carran_NPC","You thought it would be the Princess? "
"Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_WRITTEN","She doesn't rule the Council?"
"Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_WRITTEN","If not her, then who?"
"Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default","Doesn't she lead the Council?"
"Narration/&Council_00_12_Carran_NPC","No, in this chamber, she's just another delegate."
"Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_Choice","If she rules the whole Principality, who's more important?"
"Narration/&Council_00_12_Carran_NPC_02","Lady Kean, the Council's Oathkeeper, is trusted by all."
"Narration/&Council_00_15_Chamberlain_NPC","Lord Carran!"
"Narration/&Council_00_16_Carran_NPC","Yes, m'lady!"
"Narration/&Council_00_17_Chamberlain_NPC","Are these your new deputies?"
"Narration/&Council_00_18_Carran_NPC","They are, m'lady."
"Narration/&Council_00_19_Serious_Default","Very well. Pay attention. All of you."
"Narration/&Council_00_20_Serious_Slang","Pipe down. "
"Narration/&Council_00_20_Serious_Normal","Shhh, quiet everyone!"
"Narration/&Council_00_21_Chamberlain_NPC","My name is Leira Kean, Oathkeeper of the Council."
"Narration/&Council_00_22_Chamberlain_NPC","And I will be administering your vows."
"Narration/&Council_00_23_Chamberlain_NPC","Once sworn in, you will carry the authority of the Council wherever you go."
"Narration/&Council_00_24_Chamberlain_NPC","Your every action will reflect upon the Council's reputation. Remember that. Always."
"Narration/&Council_00_25_Chamberlain_NPC","Now, please, raise your right hands."
"Narration/&Council_00_26_Chamberlain_NPC","Do you, each and all, solemnly swear your lives and allegiance to this Council and promise… "
"Narration/&Council_00_27_Chamberlain_NPC","…to carry out our mission to protect our alliance from those who would threaten the common good?"
"Narration/&Council_00_28_All_Default_WRITTEN","I swear."
"Narration/&Council_00_28_All_Default","I swear."
"Narration/&Council_00_29_Chamberlain_NPC","Excellent. Lord Carran will enter your name into Council's register. Thank you for your service."
"Narration/&Council_00_30_Carran_NPC","Congratulations, deputies."
"Narration/&Council_00_31_Any_Default","Wait, that's it?"
"Narration/&Council_00_32_Joke_WRITTEN","You were expecting a parade?"
"Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_WRITTEN","That was long enough."
"Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_WRITTEN","Let's focus on the mission."
"Narration/&Council_00_32_joker_Default","What were you expecting? A parade? "
"Narration/&Council_00_32_joker_Slang","Were you hoping for a kiss from the Princess?"
"Narration/&Council_00_33_Any_Default","I suppose you imagined something more pompous."
"Narration/&Council_00_34_Any_Default","No. I don't know. It just feels a bit… anticlimactic."
"Narration/&Council_00_35_Carran_NPC","Sorry to disappoint. "
"Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Choice","Frankly, the speech was long enough for my taste."
"Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran01","The formality reflects the solemnity of your oath."
"Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran02","But more would probably be… immodest."
"Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_Choice","Stop wasting time! What's the mission?"
"Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_Carran","Well! A motivated deputy."
"Narration/&Council_00_42_Carran_NPC","So - the mission:"
"Narration/&Council_00_44_Carran_NPC","As I'm sure you know, the Council maintains a number of outposts… "
"Narration/&Council_00_45_Carran_NPC","…to secure the border between the Principality and the Marches."
"Narration/&Council_00_46_Carran_NPC","One of them is the former Imperial Fortress, Caer Lem."
"Narration/&Council_00_47_Carran_NPC","It is held by some fifty troops under the command of Captain Henrik."
"Narration/&Council_00_48_Carran_NPC","He sends us weekly status reports - or rather, he used to."
"Narration/&Council_00_49_Carran_NPC","We haven't heard a word from him in three weeks."
"Narration/&Council_00_50_Carran_NPC","Leave immediately for Caer Lem and find out if anyone there is still alive."
"Narration/&Council_00_51_Carran_NPC","If Captain Henrik or anyone else is still breathing, bring them back."
"Narration/&Council_00_52_Carran_NPC","The Council wants a first-hand report."
"Narration/&Council_00_53_Dangerous_WRITTEN","Sounds dangerous."
"Narration/&Council_00_54_Marches_WRITTEN","Wait - you spoke of the Marches?"
"Narration/&Council_00_55_Henrik_WRITTEN","Tell us about Captain Henrik."
"Narration/&Council_00_56_ExitLine_WRITTEN","We're good to go."
"Narration/&Council_00_57_Dangerous_Choice","A whole garrison, gone? There are only four of us."
"Narration/&Council_00_58_Dangerous_Carran01","Just find out what happened. Run back if you get scared."
"Narration/&Council_00_42_Joker_Normal","Got it. Though we were hoping for a first mission with more riches than risk, if you catch my drift."
"Narration/&Council_00_42_Joker_Slang","We hear ya. Just so you know, we'd like to start slow. Meaning more treasure. Less danger."
"Narration/&Council_00_59_Carran_NPC","You don't get to choose your mission, I'm afraid."
"Narration/&Council_00_53_Carran_NPC","So gather what you need and go. Time is of the essence."
"Narration/&Council_00_60_Marches_Choice","Wait! These Marches - they're not in the Badlands, are they?"
"Narration/&Council_00_61_Marches_Carran01","The Marches are a no-man's-land, between the civilized world and the Badlands."
"Narration/&Council_00_62_Marches_Carran02","It's outside the chain of mountains that really define the Badlands."
"Narration/&Council_00_63_Marches_Carran03","We wouldn't send you in there… yet."
"Narration/&Council_00_64_Henrik_Choice","What can you tell us about this Captain Henrik?"
"Narration/&Council_00_65_Henrik_Carran01","A fine officer. More than fifteen years in the Principality's army."
"Narration/&Council_00_66_Henrik_Carran02","He inspires trust, loyalty, and courage - hence the decision to post him there, facing danger."
"Narration/&Council_00_54_Any_Default","Right, I guess that's that. It's on to Caer Lem."
"Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_1_PotionShopOwner_NPC","Hello! How may I help you?"
"Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN","What do you sell?"
"Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN","Can we see your wares?"
"Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_4_Any_Default","What do you sell here?"
"Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_5_PotionShopOwner_NPC","Mostly potions, for heroic adventurers like yourselves."
"Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_6_PotionShopOwner_NPC","I also have recipes for customers who like to craft their own."
"Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_7_PotionShopOwner_NPC","And ingredients too - even rare flowers from the Badlands."
"Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_8_PotionShopOwner_NPC","Come back any time - I'm almost always open!"
"Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_1_StoreOwner_NPC","Welcome to Gorim's Emporium!"
"Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN","Are you Gorim?"
"Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN","What do you sell?"
"Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN","Can we see your wares?"
"Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_5_Any_Default","Are you Gorim?"
"Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_6_StoreOwner_NPC","That's me! The one and only."
"Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_7_Any_Default","What do you have to sell?"
"Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_8_StoreOwner_NPC","Everything you'll need for going out there into the Badlands…"
"Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_9_StoreOwner_NPC","…food, ropes, torches - and of course, armor and weapons."
"Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_10_StoreOwner_NPC","I also have some other stock, like remedies and antitoxins. "
"Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_11_StoreOwner_NPC","They might come in handy. Ever heard of deep spiders?"
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_1_Bartender_NPC","Hello, adventurers!"
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_2_Bartender_NPC","What can I offer you?"
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN","Tell us about this place."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN","Your beer tastes bad."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_Any_WRITTEN","We need a room."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any_WRITTEN","Goodbye."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any","We should go."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_6_Any_Default","Tell us about your tavern."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_7_Bartender_NPC","The inn? Well, it's not that old, but somehow it feels like it's been here forever."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_8_Bartender_NPC","You can meet all kinds of people here, that's the good thing."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_9_Bartender_NPC","An old Scavenger, a diplomat from the Council, a knight, a lord, a beggar…"
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_Bartender_NPC","We also have rooms to rent by the night."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_1_Any_Default","Why the name - Gravekeep's Cask?"
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_2_Bartender_NPC","It's very old, from Imperial times. Perhaps a historian would know, but I don't."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_11_Any_Default","Your beer is terrible, and that's being polite about it."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_12_Bartender_NPC","What? I've never had any complaints about the beer before!"
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_13_Bartender_NPC","Maybe your palate is not refined enough."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default","We'd like to stay for the night."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_15_Bartender_NPC","Sure! Just walk up to the suite and settle in."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_16_Any_Default","A suite? "
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_17_Bartender_NPC","It's more like a large bedroom, really - but you know, this is the capital city."
"Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_NoMoneyToPay","No money, eh. No room, then. "
"Narration/&Scavengers_Generic_Hello","Clear skies, my friends."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Generic_Goodbye","Stay in the light, my friends."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_1_Quartermaster_NPC","Deputies? A word, if you please."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_2_Joker_Default","So famous already? I love it!"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_3_Any_Default","You were in there, too. Are you a member of the Council?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_4_Quartermaster_NPC","I'm Annie Bagmordah, Quartermaster of the Scavenger's guild."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_5_Quartermaster_NPC","We don't have a seat in there, but…"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_6_Quartermaster_NPC","…they all know exploring the Badlands without us would be a bad idea."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_7_Quartermaster_NPC","That's why you should stop by our headquarters downtown."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_8_Quartermaster_NPC","You'll need our services, I'm sure."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_9_Any_Default","Is that… compulsory?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_10_Quartermaster_NPC","No, but you'll find our services useful. Everyone does."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_11_Quartermaster_NPC","Did lord Carran not tell you?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_12_Any_Default","No - he pretty much stuck to giving orders."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_13_Quartermaster_NPC","Ah, right. Anyway, we offer plenty of help and advice to beginners like you."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_14_Joker_Default","We are grown-ups, you know. At least, most of us are."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_15_Quartermaster_NPC","Of course you are. Well, good luck!"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_16_Lowlife_Default","At least she's not another lady or something."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_17_Lawkeeper_Default","Scavengers, eh? I never knew if they were legit or not."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_18_Sellsword_Default","They're tough, these Scavengers. Fearless."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_19_Highclass_Default","Inviting beggars to the Council? How peculiar."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_20_Acolyte_Default","I'd rather visit the temple, honestly."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_21_Nosy_Default","The Scavengers! They've seen so much already - the first explorers of the ancient empire!"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_22_Authority_Default","So what do you think? Should we check out their headquarters? "
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_23_Pragmatism_Default","It's not far, but…"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_24_Violence_Default","I've had enough talking - let's go kill some monsters!"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_25_Greed_Default","If there's business to be done, we can't afford not to!"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Quartermaster_NPC","Ah - you came!"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Any_Default","You piqued our curiosity. So - what exactly do you have to offer?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Quartermaster_NPC","You don't know? Tsk."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","What help do you offer?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_NosyAuthority_WRITTEN","Do you know Arwin Merton?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Selfpres_WRITTEN","Do you sell healing potions?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Default_WRITTEN","See you later."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Pragmatic_Default","What kind of help do you offer to people like us?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Quartermaster_NPC","Simple. Now, people like you typically carry out missions for the Council…"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_9_Quartermaster_NPC","…in the Marches, even the Badlands. Sometimes far away, like Captain Merran."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_10_NosyAuthority_Default","Who's Captain Merran?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_11_Quartermaster_NPC","You really must be new. She's one of yours: Senior Deputy of the Council."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_12_Quartermaster_NPC","Anyway - you trek out to some old ruin in the Badlands, kill a bunch of orcs…"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_13_Quartermaster_NPC","…well, you're still a bit green, so let's say goblins."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_14_Joker_Default","Ouch! You're hurting our feelings!"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_15_Quartermaster_NPC","Orcs will hurt more than your feelings, believe me."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_16_Quartermaster_NPC","And stop interrupting! It's rude."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_17_Quartermaster_NPC","So let's say you find yourself with a whole load of rusty swords, leather armor, shields…"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_18_Quartermaster_NPC","…too much for you to lug back here."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_19_Joker_Default","Oh - so we're puny as well as green? Thanks so much!"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_20_Quartermaster_NPC","So instead, you brave heroes just clear the place of monsters and draw us a nice, clean map."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_21_Quartermaster_NPC","Then we take our carts and pick up every piece of junk…"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_22_Quartermaster_NPC","…we bring it back, we sell it, and we split the profits with you."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_23_Quartermaster_NPC","We move the stuff, you go off to kill more bad things, everybody wins."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_24_Joker_Default","For a percentage, of course."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_25_Quartermaster_NPC","What? You could never carry it all, anyway."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_26_Quartermaster_NPC","Not in your little backpacks."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_27_NosyAuthority_Default","Do you know Arwin Merton, the so-called First Scavenger?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_28_Quartermaster_NPC","Of course."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_29_NosyAuthority_Default","That's it?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_30_Quartermaster_NPC","Merton… it's a painful topic for me. "
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_31_Quartermaster_NPC","I'd rather not talk about him."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_32_Friendly_Default","Fair enough."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_33_Selfpres_Default","Do you sell healing potions?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_34_Quartermaster_NPC","No, we don't. There's a shop for that."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_35_Quartermaster_NPC","However…"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_36_Quartermaster_NPC","We've got something even better."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_37_Quartermaster_NPC","Say one of you gets killed out there in the Badlands."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_38_Joker_Default","Here we go again…"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_39_Quartermaster_NPC","Normally, you'd have to come back in a hurry to get them raised."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_40_Quartermaster_NPC","Instead, you tell us about your misfortune, and we'll go get your friend's body."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_41_Quartermaster_NPC","We take it to a cleric we know, and praise be! He raises your friend from the dead."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_42_Quartermaster_NPC","It's a flat fee, and very reasonably priced."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_43_Quartermaster_NPC","Not a comfortable subject, I know. Perish the thought and so on - but it happens."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_44_Greed_Default","That's not cheap, I'm sure."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_45_Quartermaster_NPC","Well… it's risky, and clerics need pretty gemstones for these spells… but can you really put a price on peace of mind?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_46_Authority_Default","Well, thank you. I guess that's it for us."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_47_Quartermaster_NPC","Fine. Feel free to visit us anytime. Or drop into any Scavenger camp."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_48_Nosy_Authority_Default","Are there others?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_49_Quartermaster_NPC","Anywhere we can settle. "
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_50_Quartermaster_NPC","By the way, if you find Captain Henrik, tell him we're still interested."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_51_Authority_Default","In what?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_52_Quartermaster_NPC","In getting our people to Caer Lem."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_53_Quartermaster_NPC","The outpost is perfect for us. Close to the Badlands, with plenty of space for our camp."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_54_Authority_Default","Right, we'll tell him if we find him."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_55_Quartermaster_NPC","That would be appreciated. "
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_56_Quartermaster_NPC","The more you do for us, the more we do for you."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_57_Greed_Default","Oh? So this… business relationship can get better?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_58_Quartermaster_NPC","And I hope it will, friend."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_59_Any_Default","I guess we'll see you around, then."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_60_Quartermaster_NPC","Sure. Good luck out there, and don't forget - in the Badlands, always keep your eyes open."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival1_Starter_Noflag","So that's Caer Lem?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival2_Partner_Noflag","We're almost there… it's just up the hill."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival3_SelfPres_Noflag","It's a little too quiet, don't you think?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival4_Pragmatism_Slang","We're in the Marches, so quiet can't be trusted."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival5_SelfPres_Normal","True. Let's keep our eyes open."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival6_SelfPres_Formal","Quite so. We must be on our guard."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival7_Authority_Normal","Eyes up and hands on hilts, people. These are the Marches."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival8_Authority_Formal","Hold formation, all! The Marches are full of perils."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival9_Selfish_Cynical_Normal","Who put you in charge?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival10_Selfish_Cynical_Slang","Don't play the captain with me."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival11_Authority_Normal","I'm just saying, be ready for anything."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival12_Authority_Formal","Simply a suggestion. I meant no offense."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival13_Default_Slang","Damn right. Let's get on with it."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival14_Default_Normal","All right. Let's just keep going."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival15_Default_Formal","Agreed. We should press on."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance16_Default_Noflag","I have a bad feeling about this."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance17_Partner_Slang","Where's the garrison? Dead or run away?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance18_Partner_Normal","There's no one here. Not even corpses."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance19_Default_Noflag","Look! That tower… that's insane!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance20_NOSY_Noflag","Amazing! Classic Tirmarian architecture… I read about that, you know."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance21_NOSY_Noflag","It just ended up here after the Cataclysm… incredible!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance22_LUKEWARM_Slang","Courtesy of the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance23_LUKEWARM_Slang","The Marches are full of stuff like this. The Badlands are worse."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance24_Cynic_Normal","I never saw a tower just stuck in a mountain like that."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance25_Default_Normal","We're not in the Badlands yet, but that's a good introduction."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance26_Authority_law_Noflag","Anyway, we have a mission. Let's check the fortifications."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield1_Cynical_Formal","Well, that's not a good sign."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield2_Cynical_Normal","Does this tell us anything we don't already know?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield3_Pragmatic_Normal","The blood isn't that fresh, but even vultures would have left some bones behind."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield4_Pragmatic_Formal","There's enough blood here to suggest that the whole garrison was massacred."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield5_Any_Normal","Maybe it was the goblins… they took the soldiers and… ate them?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield6_Pragmatic_Normal","Those goblins were only a handful… A fifty-strong garrison would have made mincemeat of them."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield7_Any_Normal","Well then, I'm out of ideas. Let's keep looking around."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Inside27_Pragmatism_Noflag","There's definitely been fighting here."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Inside28_cynicWISECRACKER_Noflag","Why did we take this job again? Oh, yeah… these lovely Council badges."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Inside29_cynicWISECRACKER_Formal","No one here to greet us? How rude! I was hoping for drinks, at least."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Inside30_Authority_React","This is no time for jokes."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Inside31_Selfpres_Noflag","Right. Whoever did this could still be around, and we don't want them hearing us."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Inside32_Helpful_Noflag","We should look for survivors. Fifty people can't just vanish."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem33_Starter_Normal","Did you see that?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem34_Starter_Slang","What the heck was that?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem35_Partner_Default","Someone's hiding inside the tower."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem36_Self_Pres_Default","It's a trap! The goblins killed everyone, and now it's our turn!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem37_Helpful_Default","Or they're the survivors, and they're being cautious."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem38_Pragmatism_Default","We need to get up to that door."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem39_Selfpres_Default","That won't be easy. These walls are falling apart."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem40_Violence_Default","If they slaughtered the garrison, they'll pay!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem41_Beryl_NPC","Back off! No closer!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem42_Starter_Default","Who's there?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem43_Robar_NPC","We're not letting you in!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem44_Beryl_NPC","And we're not coming out!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem47_Starter_Default","Is Captain Henrik there? We need to talk to him!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem48_Beryl_NPC","Don't you dare speak his name, you filthy bastard!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem49_Robar_NPC","Don't talk to them!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem50_Lisbath_NPC","They'll cast a spell on you!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem51_Beryl_NPC","Don't touch me!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem52_Pragmatism_Normal","Is something not right in there, or is it just me?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem53_Pragmatism_Slang","Lost their minds, the lot of 'em."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem54_Pragmatism_Formal","Clearly their distressing experience has affected their reason."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem55_Joker_Normal","Filthy bastard'. Should we write that down in our report?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem56_Joker_Slang","That's our report, then: they've all gone crazy. Mystery solved."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego78_Practical_Default","Let's get to the door. Maybe if they can see us up close… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego79_Practical_Default","…we can show them our Council badges."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego1_Robar_NPC","They're here!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego2_Beryl_NPC","You damn Soraks!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego3_Starter_Default","Soraks?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego4_Partner_Default","Did they say Soraks?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego5_Starter_Slang","Ooh, they spotted it… we're shapeshifters from another world! Guess we'll have to go home now."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego6_Starter_Normal","You can't be serious! Soraks are a legend for scaring children. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego7_Beryl_NPC","You bastards took the Captain, but you won't take us!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego8_Robar_NPC","Don't talk to them!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego9_Choice_1_WRITTEN","We're Council deputies!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego10_Choice_2_WRITTEN","Use spy call phrase"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego11_Choice_3_WRITTEN","Use sellsword experience"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego12_Choice_4_WRITTEN","Be reasonable!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego13_Authority_Normal","We're deputies of the Council, sent by Protector Leira Kean!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego14_Beryl_FailedCheck","Nice to meet you… I'm Princess Ceiwad. Get lost!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego15_Lisbath_FailedCheck","Open the damn door, there are only four of them."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego16_Robar_SuccessCheck","They have Council badges."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego17_Beryl_SuccessCheck","Sure. Of course they do! Looted from whose corpses?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego18_Spy_Default","So, sleeping in the beds of the Manacalon, are you?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego19_Beryl_NPC","What?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego20_Defaulter_Default","What was that?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego21_Spy_Default","Just fishing. Give it a moment."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego22_Darik_NPC","Magic pillows give us sweet dreams."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego24_Sellsword_Default","I know how you feel… I fought at Sandreed. Lost a lot of good friends there."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego25_Robar_NPC","Sandreed, eh? Which unit?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego26_Beryl_NPC","What happened to ""don't talk to them""?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego27_Sellsword_Default","The Longswords, under Lord Dalmore."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego28_Sellsword_Default","He died on the third day… arrow in the eye. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego29_Sellsword_Default","Jonas Mills was the real leader… fought to the bitter end."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego30_Robar_NPC","Open up… they're not Soraks."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego31_Defaulter_Default","Be reasonable and open the door. We're friendlies!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego32_Beryl_NPC","Exactly what a Sorak would say."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego33_Defaulter_Default","Come on! There are just four of us… Point crossbows at us if you like."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego34_Lisbath_NPC","Let's do that! People… crossbows at the ready."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego35_Robar_NPC","Fine with me. Daliat, open the door."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego36_Beryl_NPC","No! I said no!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego37_Robar_NPC","Close the door."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego38_Starter_Default","Thank you for letting us in."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego39_Beryl_NPC","Don't thank me."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_WRITTEN","Are you the officer?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_WRITTEN","You thought we were Soraks?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_WRITTEN","Can we talk to the others?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_Default","Are you in charge here?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego41_Beryl_NPC","Lieutenant Beryl Stonebeard."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego42_Beryl_NPC","Second in command… After Captain Henrik."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_Default","So, you really believe you were attacked by Soraks?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego44_Beryl_NPC","Man-sized lizards that can speak? "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego45_Beryl_NPC","Oh, yeah… they're real."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego46_Starter_NPC","But we found no corpses… nothing."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego47_Beryl_NPC","We know. They took all the bodies, ours and theirs."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego48_Beryl_NPC","So no one can prove they exist."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","That's awkward."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","That's hard to believe."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","That's garbage."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_Normal","No proof… that's kind of awkward."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_Formal","You realize, of course, how improbable that sounds?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_Slang","Course they did… just to make you look crazy."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego52_Beryl_NPC","You won't laugh when they come back."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego53_Default_Default","We got here without trouble."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego54_Beryl_NPC","Then they let you in… and now you're trapped with us."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego55_Starter_Default","Why would they do that?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego56_Beryl_NPC","How should I know? They're Soraks!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego57_Starter_Slang","Mind if we talk to your buddies?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_Formal","Might we have a little chat with your comrades in arms?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego59_Starter_Normal","We'd like to talk to everyone here, if that's all right?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego60_Beryl_NPC","As long as you don't try anything clever, we're good."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik1_Spy_Default","I might have a better chance with this guy… alone."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_SelfpresLawful_Default","I don't like being kept in the dark."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik3_Spy_Default","I used to work in an embassy. Learned a few tricks."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik4_Starter_Default","He doesn't strike me as the diplomatic type."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik5_Mean_Default","He looks like any other beggar."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik6_Spy_Default","Come on, trust me."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik7_Nosy_Default","What exactly is it between you and him?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik8_Einar_Default","We trust you to do what's best for us all."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik9_Pakri_Default","Pakri watches. Don't betray her trust."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik10_Spy_Default","Leave the goddess out of this, will you?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik11_Defaulter_Default","If you do then, please, be our guest."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik12_Spy_NPC","I saw a Whisperer's code carved in the door."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik13_Darik_NPC","How do you know the code?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik14_Spy_Default","I used to work for Delanim, at the embassy near the New Empire border."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik15_Darik_NPC","I see. I'm supposed to kill anyone who knows those words and isn't a Whisperer."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik16_Spy_Default","I'd appreciate if you didn't kill me, though."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik17_Darik_NPC","We'll see."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik18_Spy_Default","So, just to be sure, is any of this part of your business, or… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik19_Darik_NPC","Wiping out a whole garrison just to get myself trapped with this bunch? No, that wasn't my plan."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik20_Spy_Default","So… Soraks? Really?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21_Darik_NPC","What can I tell you? They looked just like the stories say."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik22_Darik_NPC","The Captain betrayed us… they knew everything about our security."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik23_Darik_NPC","Even hiding their bodies is in the stories."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik24_Starter_Default","Think they're still around?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik25_Darik_NPC","Possibly."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik26_Spy_Default","Any idea what they're after?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik27_Darik_NPC","No."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik28_Spy_Default","Right. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik29_Spy_Default","They'll want to talk to you."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik30_Darik_NPC","Fine."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik31_Spy_Default","He's all yours."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik32_Starter_Default","So who are you, friend?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik33_Darik_NPC","Daliat Sunbird, scout."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik34_Starter_Default","Do you believe they were Soraks?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik35_Darik_NPC","Dunno. Seemed real, though."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik36_Starter_Default","What do you think they wanted? "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik37_Darik_NPC","To kill us all."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik38_Any_Normal","Not big on talk, eh?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik39_Any_Formal","You seem a very reluctant conversationalist."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik40_Darik_NPC","I'm gonna rest now."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik40_Alternate_Darik_NPC","I'm having a pretty bad day, so if you'll excuse me…"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik41_AnySelfpres_NPC","Is it me, or didn't he like that last question?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik42_Cynical_NPC","Nice man."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik43_Starter_Default","How about you? Did you learn anything?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik44_Spy_Default","Not much. He thinks the Soraks are real, too."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik45_Partner_Default","So much for your secret code."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik46_Spy_Default","Sorry to disappoint."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath1_Lisbath_NPC","Now it's my turn, right?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath2_Starter_Default","What do you mean?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath3_Lisbath_NPC","What is this? A murder investigation?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath4_Cynical_WRITTEN","Should it be?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath5_Defaulter_WRITTEN","Just trying to help."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath6_Authority_WRITTEN","Anything we should know?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath7_Cynical_Default","Should we be investigating?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath7_Lisbath_NPC","Maybe. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath8_Authority_Formal","You've said too much to stop now. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath9_Authority_Normal","Speak up, then. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath10_Lisbath_NPC","Well, let's say this all happened after a certain expedition. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath11_Any_Normal","Go on."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath12_Any_Slang","Spit it out."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath13_Any_Formal","Speak up without fear, friend."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath14_Lisbath_NPC","The scouts. They came back from a raid into the Badlands. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath15_Lisbath_NPC","Found a ruin, came back with loot. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath16_Lisbath_NPC","The next day, this happens. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath17_Lisbath_NPC","Coincidence? You tell me. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath18_Any_Default","The scouts, you say?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath19_Lisbath_NPC","Only one of them's still alive."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath20_Lisbath_NPC","Daliat."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath21_Any_Default","Right."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath22_Defaulter_Default","We just want to help."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath23_Lisbath_NPC","Good luck with that."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath24_Authority_Default","You sound worried. Anything we should know?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath25_Lisbath_NPC","Get lost!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath26_Defaulter_WRITTEN","Sorry."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath27_Insight_WRITTEN","You're hiding something."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath28_Authority_WRITTEN","I don't like your tone."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath29_Mean_WRITTEN","Go to hell."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath30_Defaulter_Default","No offense intended."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath31_Insight_Default","I'll take that as a yes. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath32_Authority_Default","I don't like to be insulted."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath33_Mean_Default","You go to hell, you spineless moron."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath34_Lisbath_NPC","You should work on your manners, then. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath35_Lisbath_NPC","And I don't like to be accused of… whatever. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath36_Defaulter_WRITTEN","Never mind."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath37_Persuader_WRITTEN","We started on the wrong foot."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath38_Intimidator_WRITTEN","Speak up, or else!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath39_Deceiver_WRITTEN","We know there's a traitor."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath40_Defaulter_Default","Get lost."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath41_Persuader_Default","Can we start this over?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath42_Lisbath_Success","Listen. Something's not right."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath43_Lisbath_Failure","I don't think so."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath44_Intimidator_Default","You'll tell me sooner or later. Later's more painful."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath45_Lisbath_NPC","Friends, right?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath46_Lisbath_NPC","Bring it on."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath47_Deceiver_Default","We know there's a traitor among you."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath48_Deceiver_Default","Help us, and we'll help you."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath49_Lisbath_Success","I… I knew it. It's Daliat, right?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath50_Lisbath_NPC","Shh! He's looking at us!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath51_Lisbath_NPC","I'll tell you what."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath52_Lisbath_Failure","You think you can fool me that easily?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath53_Lisbath_NPC","I don't buy it."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath55_AsAYes","You must have a hearing problem, then."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar1_Starter_Default","Hey, there."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Starter_Formal","Greetings, soldier."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar3_Robar_NPC","Aye."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar4_Robar_NPC","Name's Robar Sharp."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar5_Starter_Normal","Sounds like you're the most experienced here, Robar."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar6_Starter_Formal","I gather you are a veteran of long standing?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar7_Starter_Slang","So you're the old sweat of the group, huh?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar8_Robar_NPC","Yeah. But I'm not in charge, mind you."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar9_Starter_Default","Tell us about Stonebeard."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar10_Partner_Default","Tell us about Daliat."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar11_Commentator_Default","Tell us about Lisbath."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar11_Reactor_Default","What should we do?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar12_Sellsword_Default","Mercenary small talk"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar13_Partner_Default","This Lieutenant Stonebeard… is she up to the job?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar14_Robar_NPC","Clearly not. Look around."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar15_Robar_NPC","Losing the captain broke her."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar16_Partner_Default","What do you think of Daliat?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar17_Robar_NPC","Never liked him. He's hiding something."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar18_Robar_NPC","He's been nervous since we came back from the Badlands."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar19_Robar_NPC","But it'd be no good picking a fight with him now… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar20_Starter_Formal","Very wise."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar21_Starter_Normal","I understand."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar22_Commentator_Default","How about Lisbath? You're her superior?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar23_Robar_NPC","Good woman. Strong, brave."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_NPC","You can trust her with a sword… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_NPC","…that's worth something in my book."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar26_Sellsword_Default","So you fought at Sandreed too?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar27_Robar_NPC","Oh, yeah. Got the scars from rebel arrows to prove it."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar28_Sellsword_NPC","Oh, those damned skirmishers! They gave me a few holes, too."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar29_Sellsword_Default","Well, if we survived Sandreed, we'll both make it through this."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar30_Robar_NPC","That's the plan."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar31_Starter_Default","So what do you think we should do?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar31_Robar_NPC","For starters, not wait in here for the Soraks to come back and off us."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar32_Sellsword_Default","But Stonebeard says stay, and she's an officer, so… ?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar33_Sellsword_Default","Yeah. She's a stubborn one, and mutiny's a bad look on a soldier."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar34_Robar_NPC","You could talk to her, deputy of the Council and all."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar35_Sellsword_Default","So if we find a way, you're with us?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar36_Starter_Default","I'm with myself. But don't let that stop you."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal1_Authority_Normal","Right… we need to make a decision here."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal2_Authority_Formal","It's clear that something must be done."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal3_Einar_Normal","The Soraks are real? It's a lot to take in."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal4_Einar_Formal","I'm shocked by the thought that Soraks might be real."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal5_Mean_Slang","They're either crazy or stupid… no use to us in either case."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal6_Cynical_Normal","We have enough to make our report to the Council, so let's get going."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal7_Cynical_Formal","They can't help themselves or anyone else. We should return to Caer Cyflen."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal8_Cynical_Slang","Let 'em rot. We're supposed to bring back Henrik, not them. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal9_Helpful_Normal","If we don't help them, they'll either die or kill each other."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal10_Violent_Normal","Let them. Could be fun to watch."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal11_Selpres_Normal","This place is a death trap, we should get out while we can."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal12_Defaulter_Normal","So everyone has an opinion… but what are we going to do?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal13_Defaulter_Normal","And what about Daliat? We got some pretty worrying hints about him."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal14_Defaulter_Normal","What if he really is hiding something important?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal15_Authority_WRITTEN","We confront him."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal16_Violent_WRITTEN","He might be a traitor."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal17_Default_WRITTEN","It's just gossip."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal18_Selfpres_WRITTEN","Let's not risk a fight."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal19_Authority_Normal","We need to talk to him, find out the truth."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal20_Violent_Answer","If he's a traitor, we can't look the other way."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal21_Default_Answer","It's just paranoia, or personal grudges."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal22_Selfpres_Answer","If we accuse him, it might end in blood."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal23_Default_Answer","That leaves us with the others. What's our strategy?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal24_Autority_WRITTEN","We take the lead."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal25_Selpres_WRITTEN","We get out of here."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal26_Default_WRITTEN","Let's talk to them all together."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal27_Cynicsm_WRITTEN","We push Sharp to mutiny."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal28_Authority_Answer","We tell Stonebeard we're in charge, and take them home."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal29_Selpres_Answer","We get the hell out of here. They can either follow or stay here to die."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal30_Default_Answer","Let's just get them together and discuss this."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal31_Cynicsm_Answer","We tell Sharp to challenge Stonebeard, with our support."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal32_Any_Reaction","All right."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal33_Any_Reaction","I'm not sure, but… fine."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal34_Any_Reaction","Agreed."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal35_Any_Reaction","I don't think that's a good idea."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Internal36_Any_Reaction","We can't do that."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik201_Starter_Default","We need to talk."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik202_Darik_NPC","Do we?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice1_WRITTEN","Not now."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_WRITTEN","You were with an expedition recently."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_bailout","Well… maybe later."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik203_Starter_Formal","Word is you took part in an expedition to the Badlands."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik204_Starter_Normal","About this trip to the Badlands."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik205_Darik_NPC","That's what we do, here."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik206_Starter_Default","The Soraks attacked after you came back."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik207_Darik_NPC","So what - I brought them here?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik208_Whisperer_Default","Listen, colleague… you can trust me."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik209_Darik_NPC","You, maybe… but the others? "
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik210_Starter_Default","Did you bring something back?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik211_Darik_NPC","We always do, like the Scavengers."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik212_Darik_NPC","Ask Sharp, he has tons of things brought back from there."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik213_Starter_Default","But maybe this time, you took something special."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik214_Darik_NPC","It's nothing of value to Soraks!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik215_Starter_Default","How would you know?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik216_Whisperer_Default","Show me, colleague."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik217_Persuader_Default","Just trust us."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik218_Intimidate_Default","We could simply take it."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik219_Deceiver_Default","We can pay for it."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik220_Defaulter_Default","We're not blaming you, but we need to know."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik221_Darik_NPC","It's just an old book… might be of historical value."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik222_Darik_NPC","Take it, then. And find a way to get us out of here."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik223_Deceiver_Default","The Council will reward you if you help us."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik224_Darik_NPC","You won't buy me with words."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik225_Intimidate_Default","Show us, or we'll help ourselves."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik226_Darik_NPC","I don't think so."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik227_Darik_NPC","No."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik228_Persuade","Trust us. We're all on the same side here."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik229_Default_NPC","We just need to know."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik230_Darik_NPC","Hey, what's that? Hey!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_0_Salutations","Hey, there!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_1_Salutations","Deputies."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_WRITTEN","Never mind."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice2_WRITTEN","We want you to take the lead."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_Bailout","Never mind. We'll come back later."
"Narration/&CaerLem_End6_Robar_NPC","Aye."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar21_Authority_Normal","Robar, we want you to take over from Beryl."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar22_Robar_NPC","She'll refuse."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar23_Authority_Normal","We'll back you up. She won't have a choice."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_Refuse_NPC","No can do… it won't work."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_Refuse_NPC","Right, but you deal with her if she gets mad."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar26_Beryl_NPC","What's that?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar27_Authority_Normal","We believe Robar should assume command of your… remaining garrison."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar28_Beryl_NPC","Him? Just like that?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar29_Authority_Normal","We order it, as deputies of the Council."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar210_Lisbath_NPC","Bullshit."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar211_Robar_NPC","Told ya."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar212_Authority_Normal","Step down, Lieutenant, that's an order."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar213_Beryl_NPC","In your dreams!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar214_Beryl_NPC","He'll get you killed."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar215_Cynic_Normal","She took that well."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar216_Any_Normal","So boss, what's the plan?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar217_Any_Formal","Right then, what do you say, officer?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar218_Robar_NPC","What the… ?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar219_Robar_LisbathAttacked","Lisbath!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Robar220_Robar_BerylAttacked","Lieutenant!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl21_Authority_Default","Can we talk?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl22_Beryl_NPC","What now?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_WRITTEN","We'll come back later."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice2_WRITTEN","You should step down."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_bailout","Sorry, we'll come back later."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_beryl","You do that."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl23_Authority_Default","You need to step down."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl24_Beryl_NPC","Oh? And why is that?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl25_Authority_Normal","This command… this situation… is clearly too much for you."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl26_Authority_Formal","Without wishing to cause offense, you simply lack the experience this situation requires."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl27_Authority_Slang","Because you're no damn use… that's why!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl28_Persuasion_NPC","You think I'm happy to be in charge of this mess?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl29_Intimidation_WRITTEN","We are taking command."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl210_Persuasion_WRITTEN","Robar should lead."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl211_Highclass_WRITTEN","Your ancestors would agree."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl212_Intimidation_Default","We are relieving you of command, in the name of the Council."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl213_Beryl_NPC","You… well… chain of command, I suppose."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl214_Beryl_NPC","Fine… you get us out of this, deputies!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl215_Beryl_NPC","Go boil your head!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl216_Persuasion_Default","Robar Sharp will command in your stead."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl217_Beryl_NPC","A former sellsword? There's a reason he's not an officer."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl218_Persuasion_Default","He's capable enough."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl219_Sellsword_Default","Mind your words."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl220_Highclass_Default","Your noble ancestors wouldn't like you to die rotting in there."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl221_Beryl_NPC","Maybe you're right."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl222_Beryl_NPC","I can't believe you're doing this to me!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl223_Any_Formal","How dare you?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl224_Any_Slang","Go boil your head!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl225_Any_Normal","I don't like your tone."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_NPC","Hey, what's that… ?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl227_Beryl_RobarAttacked","Robar!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_LisbathAttacked","Lisbath!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled1_Beryl_NPC","You've got some explaining to do…"
"Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled2_Starter_Default","Daliat was hiding this from you."
"Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled3_Authority_Formal","We believe it may have attracted the Soraks."
"Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled4_Authority_Normal","That's probably why they attacked."
"Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled5_Any_Default","He refused to let it go, despite the danger."
"Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled6_Robar_NPC","I'm not surprised. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled7_Lisbath_NPC","Me neither."
"Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled8_Beryl_NPC","That's it? So when it's your turn to be killed, I should just say that?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled9_Robar_NPC","Wait… what… ?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled10_Robar_NPC","Lisbath!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled1_Lisbath_NPC","Robar, no!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled2_Beryl_NPC","I'm sorry… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled3_Lisbath_NPC","You… this is all your fault… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled4_Violence_Default","Soldiers die. You should know that."
"Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled5_Maraike_Default","Maraike will take his soul to peace."
"Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled6_Einar_Default","Don't be fooled, the Soraks are responsible… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled7_Einar_Default","…and many others will fall if we don't report to the Council."
"Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled8_Jugdmental_Default","Don't you think it's time to stop bickering?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled9_Lisbath_NPC","You people - just leave me alone!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled10_Beryl_NPC","You can't do that! "
"Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo1_Selpfresprag_Default","He came from here! Look!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo2_Any_Default","What's this? A secret passage?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo3_Any_Default","From Imperial times… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo4_Selpfresprag_Default","That was just a scout… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo5_Selpfresprag_Default","…more will be coming."
"Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo6_Default","They're here!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo7_Default","They're coming back! Outside!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo8_Selfpres_Prag_Default","We need to go! Take your stuff."
"Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo9_Selfpres_Prag_Default","Into the secret passage, before it's too late!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled1_Robar_NPC","Lisbath!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled2_Beryl_NPC","I'm sorry… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled3_Robar_NPC","I should have… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled4_Sellsword_Default","Stay with us, brother. We're not the enemy."
"Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled5_Robar_NPC","Soraks… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled6_Beryl_NPC","Right. Who's crazy now?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled7_Einar_Default","We must alert the Council!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled8_Selfpres_Normal","We need to get out of here, that's what we need!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled9_Selfpres_Formal","Surviving is what matters now."
"Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled10_Authority_Normal","Look at that skin! It's unbelievable… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled1_Lisbath_NPC","Oh, no… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled2_Robar_NPC","You know she had it coming. She failed us."
"Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled3_JudgmentalAny_Default","Happy now?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled4_Robar_NPC","We didn't do this… the… Sorak did."
"Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled5_Pragmatic_Default","Right, then. They are real."
"Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled6_Einar_Default","This is unbelievable! The Council must know!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled7_Selfpres_Default","And we need to leave, or we'll be next."
"Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled8_Jugdmental_Default","This could have been avoided if you people hadn't wasted time bickering."
"Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled9_Logical_Default","Let's focus here. We can't save her now, but we can still save ourselves."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Starter_Default","Seems quiet. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel2_Selfpres_Default","We must be cautious. Other Soraks might be scouting these caves."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel3_Partner_Default","Hey, where's Daliat?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4_Starter_Default","He was here a moment ago."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel5_Selfpres_Default","The Soraks?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel6_Beryl_NPC","Daliat always had his own secrets. "
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel7_Beryl_NPC","I think he just went his own way."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel8_Starter_Default","And the others are in the tower looking for that secret door. We don't have much choice… let's move!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Beryl_NPC","Wait… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Robar_NPC","Wait… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel2_Starter_Normal","Think they're Soraks?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel3_Starter_Formal","Are those Soraks?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4_Cynicism_Default","Who else?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel5_Violence_Default","We can surprise them."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel6_Selfpres_Default","Can't we sneak around?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel7_Prag_Default","From what I see, not a chance."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel8_Violence_Default","All right. Tread lightly, and we all attack at once."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort1_Starter_Default","What do you think?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort2_Stonecunning_Default","Typical Manacalon architecture… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort3_Stonecunning_Default","…the stonecutting is textbook… "
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort4_Stonecunning_Default","…using this orange stone from the mountain."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Default","That's it? Orange stone?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Formal","Is that all? Stone?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Default","I'm not answering that."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Formal","I won't dignify that question with an answer."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort7_dunno","Maybe a dwarf could tell you about stone."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort8_dunno","I guess it's… good stone."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort9_dunno","Well, that was enlightening."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter1_Starter_Normal","What's this?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter2_Starter_Formal","What is this thing?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter3_Arcane_Normal","I think it was a Minor Gate."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter4_Arcane_Formal","I believe this was called a minor Imperial Gate."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter5_Arcane_Default","At its height, the Manacalon Empire had countless Gates like this."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter6_Arcane_Default","To magically travel through the Empire."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter7_Partner_Default","I don't suppose it still works?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter8_Arcane_Default","Some say there are still functioning Gates."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter9_Commentator_Default","And this plaque? Any value?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter10_Arcane_Default","Maybe. The Tower of Knowledge? Why not?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse1_Starter_Default","This one didn't die yesterday."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse2_Partner_Default","What's this outfit?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse3_History_Default","Tirmarian."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse4_Selfpres_Default","Who wants to open this?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse5_Greed_Default","You never know, there might be a fortune in there."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian1_Starter_Default","Can anyone read that?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian2_History_Default","It's old Tirmarian."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian3_History_Default","It looks like part of an inquisitor's outfit."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian4_Partner_Default","So that's from… the tower up there?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian5_Starter_Default","Maybe we're inside the tower?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian6_Greed_Default","Is that gold?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian7_History_Default","This is history. History, all around us!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian8_Prag_Default","Take it and let's move! The Soraks don't care about history, I'm sure."
"Narration/&CaerLem_End1_Starter_Default","We're safe!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_End2_Partner_Default","We still have to go back to Caer Cyflen."
"Narration/&CaerLem_End3_Commentator_Default","The road isn't far."
"Narration/&CaerLem_End4_Starter_Normal","We'll see you back there, all right? You'll be okay?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_End5_Starter_Formal","I suppose we'll meet again in Caer Cyflen? Are you good to return by yourselves?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_End7_Beryl_NPC","Of course."
"Narration/&CaerLem_End8_Daliat_NPC","Sure."
"Narration/&CaerLem_End9_Lisbath_NPC","Yeah."
"Narration/&Council01_1_NPC_Carran","Oh, here you are!"
"Narration/&Council01_2_NPC_Carran","How was the mission?"
"Narration/&Council01_3_Any_Practical","Successful."
"Narration/&Council01_4_Any_Exalted","You won't believe it!"
"Narration/&Council01_5_Any_Cynical","We almost died!"
"Narration/&Council01_6_Any_ReligionEinar","We must report to the Council immediately."
"Narration/&Council01_7_Any_Greedy","Not paid enough."
"Narration/&Council01_8_Any_Seenitall","Business as usual."
"Narration/&Council01_9_Any_Violent","Let's say we earned a few scars."
"Narration/&Council01_10_NPC_follows3_Carran","Good."
"Narration/&Council01_11_NPC_follows4_Carran","Let's hope the Council does, then!"
"Narration/&Council01_12_NPC_follows5_Carran","Yes here you are, safe and sound."
"Narration/&Council01_13_NPC_follows6_Carran","Of course. I'll inform the Council that you've returned."
"Narration/&Council01_14_NPC_follows7_Carran","Who is?"
"Narration/&Council01_15_NPC_follows8_Carran","I appreciate your professionalism."
"Narration/&Council01_16_NPC_follows8_Carran","There's no dishonor in a few scars."
"Narration/&Council01_17_Any_Practical","When can we hope for an audience?"
"Narration/&Council01_18_NPC_Carran","It depends… tomorrow, if you're lucky. "
"Narration/&Council01_19_NPC_Carran","Another party came back yesterday… "
"Narration/&Council01_20_NPC_Carran","…and they still have to make their report, so… "
"Narration/&Council01_21_NPC_Carran","…maybe they'll see you both at once."
"Narration/&Council01_22_Any_Practical","We have urgent news!"
"Narration/&Council01_23_Any_Practical_Slang","Listen, we can't wait around here! What we've got is big!"
"Narration/&Council01_24_Any_Practical","The outpost at Caer Lem has been attacked!"
"Narration/&Council01_25_Any_Practical","Almost all of the garrison was killed!"
"Narration/&Council01_26_NPC_Carran","By all the gods!"
"Narration/&Council01_27_NPC_Carran","Meet me in the Council chamber."
"Narration/&Council01_28_NPC_Carran","I'll inform my superiors."
"Narration/&Council01_29_Any_ReligionEinar","This cannot wait!"
"Narration/&Council01_30_Any_ReligionEinar","The Caer Lem outpost was attacked by the Soraks!"
"Narration/&Council01_31_Any_ReligionEinar","Almost all of the garrison was killed!"
"Narration/&Council01_32_NPC_Carran","Soraks?"
"Narration/&Council01_33_NPC_Carran","Is that a joke?"
"Narration/&Council01_34_Any_Other","I'm afraid not. "
"Narration/&Council01_35_Any_Other_slang","We saw them… with our own eyes!"
"Narration/&Council01_36_NPC_Carran","Well, if you want to bring that to the Council… "
"Narration/&Council01_37_NPC_Carran","…that's your decision."
"Narration/&Council01_38_NPC_Carran","If you're so eager to look like idiots… "
"Narration/&Council01_39_NPC_Carran","Meet me in the Council chamber."
"Narration/&Council01_40_NPC_Speaker","The Legacy Council is now in session."
"Narration/&Council01_41_NPC_Speaker","Captain Heather Merran has the floor."
"Narration/&Council01_42_NPC_Ed_Morgan","Ladies and gentlemen… your Royal Highness… "
"Narration/&Council01_43_NPC_Ed_Morgan","…my party and I have made a very worrying discovery."
"Narration/&Council01_44_NPC_Ed_Morgan","In the Badlands… "
"Narration/&Council01_45_NPC_Ed_Morgan","…near the place we call Black Hill… "
"Narration/&Council01_46_NPC_Ed_Morgan","…we saw a group that we took to be Scavengers."
"Narration/&Council01_47_NPC_Ed_Morgan","They attacked us right away… "
"Narration/&Council01_48_NPC_Ed_Morgan","…but we were able to fight them off."
"Narration/&Council01_49_NPC_Ed_Morgan","They were trying to get away with this."
"Narration/&Council01_50_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir","What is it?"
"Narration/&Council01_51_NPC_Ed_Morgan","This box contains a gem… A ruby, it would appear."
"Narration/&Council01_52_NPC_Ed_Morgan","We have determined that it has magical properties… "
"Narration/&Council01_53_NPC_Ed_Morgan","…and we believe the Council should examine it."
"Narration/&Council01_54_NPC_Danantar","So we will, captain, but really… "
"Narration/&Council01_55_NPC_Danantar","…is that all? "
"Narration/&Council01_56_NPC_Danantar","You called an emergency meeting of the Council for a simple magical gem?"
"Narration/&Council01_57_NPC_Danantar","Her Royal Highness has a busy schedule… "
"Narration/&Council01_58_NPC_Princess","Please, Lord Danantar, in this chamber I'm just a student of magic."
"Narration/&Council01_59_NPC_Danantar","Hear, hear!"
"Narration/&Council01_60_NPC_Danantar","Anyway, Captain, the Council has a great deal of business… "
"Narration/&Council01_61_NPC_Ed_Morgan","They were Soraks, our attackers… not Scavengers, not bandits… Soraks!"
"Narration/&Council01_62_NPC_Danantar","… "
"Narration/&Council01_63_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir","Soraks?"
"Narration/&Council01_64_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Is this a joke?"
"Narration/&Council01_65_NPC_Einar","The Sorr-Akkath are no laughing matter, Lord Faisech!"
"Narration/&Council01_66_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Oh, you know what I mean."
"Narration/&Council01_67_NPC_Princess","What do you mean, my lord?"
"Narration/&Council01_68_NPC_Tower_Faisech_Faisech","How many times has the Council heard tales of these so-called Soraks?"
"Narration/&Council01_69_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir","At least twenty, I'd say."
"Narration/&Council01_70_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","More. Twenty-three."
"Narration/&Council01_71_NPC_Danantar","More each year. It's becoming a fad."
"Narration/&Council01_72_NPC_Tower_Faisech","I'm sorry, Captain, but… you are certain that you encountered Soraks?"
"Narration/&Council01_73_PlayerChoice_Default","We did, too!"
"Narration/&Council01_74_PlayerChoice_Exalted","It's true! They're real!"
"Narration/&Council01_75_PlayerChoice_Authoritative","If you doubt her word, you can trust ours! We fought Soraks ourselves!"
"Narration/&Council01_76_PlayerChoice_Practical","She's telling the truth!"
"Narration/&Council01_77_NPC_Tower_Faisech","What?"
"Narration/&Council01_78_NPC_Tower_Faisech","And who might you be?"
"Narration/&Council01_79_NPC_LeiraKean","Some new recruits, my lord. They were sworn in quite recently."
"Narration/&Council01_80_NPC_Tower_Faisech","New recruits, eh? They place too much stock in rumor, it seems."
"Narration/&Council01_81_NPC_LeiraKean","They assure me that they saw Soraks as well."
"Narration/&Council01_82_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","Wait!"
"Narration/&Council01_83_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","Do you realize how serious this is?"
"Narration/&Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1_WRITTEN","We do."
"Narration/&Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2_WRITTEN","We saw them."
"Narration/&Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3_WRITTEN","They attacked Caer Lem."
"Narration/&Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1","We do."
"Narration/&Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2","The Soraks are real! We saw them… we fought them!"
"Narration/&Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3","They attacked the Caer Lem outpost… the garrison suffered severe losses!"
"Narration/&Council01_87_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_1","We have never had two sightings reported at the same time."
"Narration/&Council01_88_NPC_Tower_Faisech_1","Pah! Does that make this nonsense more believable?"
"Narration/&Council01_89_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_2","Two sightings - independent witnesses! When will you see the truth?"
"Narration/&Council01_90_NPC_Morgan_2","Yes, sir!"
"Narration/&Council01_91_NPC_Morgan_2","Reptilians… fast, strong… "
"Narration/&Council01_92_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","…they can climb on walls just like spiders!"
"Narration/&Council01_93_PlayerSelection_Default","…they're tough, too!"
"Narration/&Council01_94_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3","Caer Lem? The outpost in the Marches? "
"Narration/&Council01_95_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3","What do you mean by heavy losses?"
"Narration/&Council01_96_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","The Soraks took over captain Henrik… "
"Narration/&Council01_97_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","…and only two of them are still alive."
"Narration/&Council01_98_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","They can testify, too."
"Narration/&Council01_99_NPC_Gormsdottir","Do you have any… material proof of their existence?"
"Narration/&Council01_100_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","I beg your pardon?"
"Narration/&Council01_101_NPC_Morgan","Like what?"
"Narration/&Council01_102_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Well… A dead body, for example!"
"Narration/&Council01_103_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Or even just a head?"
"Narration/&Council01_104_NPC_Einar","If we go to Caer Lem, will we find the bodies of these Soraks?"
"Narration/&Council01_105_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","Probably not."
"Narration/&Council01_106_NPC_Morgan","They took their dead with them when they retreated."
"Narration/&Council01_107_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","The bodies of their victims, too."
"Narration/&Council01_108_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Hm! How very convenient!"
"Narration/&Council01_109_NPC_Tower_Faisech","So you can offer us no proof of this… "
"Narration/&Council01_110_NPC_Tower_Faisech","…adventurer's fable."
"Narration/&Council01_111_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","And what if proof were to be brought before the Council?"
"Narration/&Council01_112_NPC_Tower_Faisech","What proof? How? "
"Narration/&Council01_113_NPC_Tower_Faisech","If the Soraks take away their fallen, as they say."
"Narration/&Council01_114_NPC_Danantar","That's not our problem. Let them find a way."
"Narration/&Council01_115_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind","These are new recruits, correct?"
"Narration/&Council01_116_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind","Then let this be their new mission:"
"Narration/&Council01_117_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind","Bring us the head of a Sorak, for the whole Council to see."
"Narration/&Council01_118_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","That would certainly be proof, Lord Faisech, would it not?"
"Narration/&Council01_119_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Oh, very well. Meanwhile, the Council will examine the gem."
"Narration/&Council01_120_NPC_Tower_Faisech","If there is nothing else?"
"Narration/&Council01_121_NPC_Speaker","Dean Iolair Faisech of the Tower of Knowledge calls for a recess!"
"Narration/&Council01_122_NPC_Speaker","Does any member object?"
"Narration/&Council01_123_NPC_Speaker","No? It is resolved, then! The Legacy Council is now in recess!"
"Narration/&Council01_124_NPC_Carran","That actually went better than I expected."
"Narration/&Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN","Who's the grumpy dwarf?"
"Narration/&Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar_WRITTEN","We had to stand by Merran."
"Narration/&Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility_WRITTEN","The Princess is bland."
"Narration/&Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin_WRITTEN","They are seat-warmers."
"Narration/&Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical","Who's the grumpy dwarf woman?"
"Narration/&Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar","We had to stand by Merran… We know she speaks the truth."
"Narration/&Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility","I must say, the Princess was… not what I expected."
"Narration/&Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin","They're just a bunch of politicking seat-warmers, for all their airs and graces."
"Narration/&Council01_129_NPC_Carran","Chancellor Hertha Gormsdottir, of the Guild of Antiquarians."
"Narration/&Council01_130_NPC_Carran","She's… Well, yes. Quite."
"Narration/&Council01_131_NPC_Carran","I'm sure she will appreciate your support."
"Narration/&Council01_132_NPC_Carran","Oh? And what did you expect, exactly?"
"Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN","Someone older."
"Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Highclass_WRITTEN","Someone… a little more presentable?"
"Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Authority_WRITTEN","Someone more dignified."
"Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical","A pretty, empty-headed girl. Oh, wait… "
"Narration/&Council01_134_NPC_Carran","Mind your words! She may rank low on the Council… "
"Narration/&Council01_135_NPC_Carran","…but she is our sovereign, and she is well loved in the Principality."
"Narration/&Council01_136_PlayerChoice_Authoritative","A more… how to put it? A more commanding personality?"
"Narration/&Council01_137_NPC_Carran","Ah, well… she is young still. And she has many other qualities."
"Narration/&Council01_138_PlayerChoice_Nobility","Someone more… regal?"
"Narration/&Council01_139_NPC_Carran","No one is more regal than our Princess, believe me!"
"Narration/&Council01_140_Player_Nobility","You know what I mean."
"Narration/&Council01_141_NPC_Carran","No, actually… I don't."
"Narration/&Council01_142_PlayerChoice_Urchin","A shower of weevils. Rich, clean weevils!"
"Narration/&Council01_143_NPC_Carran","And your employers, let's not forget."
"Narration/&Council01_144_NPC_Carran","I must admit, the Legacy Council is a… complex body."
"Narration/&Council01_145_NPC_Carran","Anyway… "
"Narration/&Council01_146_NPC_Carran","…some people might want to talk to you after this."
"Narration/&Council01_147_NPC_Carran","Working for the Council, you are expected to be neutral."
"Narration/&Council01_148_PlayerChoice_Default","But?"
"Narration/&Council01_149_NPC_Carran","But you have the right to have friends."
"Narration/&Council01_150_NPC_Carran","So feel free to talk to whoever you like."
"Narration/&Council01_151_NPC_Carran","As long your allegiance remains to the Council as a whole."
"Narration/&Council01_152_PlayerChoice_Register_Formal","You may rely on our honor."
"Narration/&Council01_153_PlayerChoice_Register_normal","Of course."
"Narration/&Council01_154_PlayerChoice_Register_Slang","All right, then."
"Narration/&Council01_155_Merran_Thanks01","Hey, deputies - thanks for the support in there!"
"Narration/&Council01_156_AnyFriendly","You're welcome, Captain. "
"Narration/&Council01_157_Merran_Thanks02","So, those bastards got Henrik? Shame."
"Narration/&Council01_158_Curious","You knew him?"
"Narration/&Council01_159_Merran_Thanks03","Yes, indeed. I wonder who'll volunteer to retake Caer Lem now..."
"Narration/&Council01_160_Friendly","The Scavengers could lead the way."
"Narration/&Council01_161_Merran_Thanks04","Yeah. They'll find a bunch of hotheads to retake the fort, I'm sure."
"Narration/&Council01_162_Merran_Thanks05","Stay in the light, friends!"
"Narration/&Council01_163_Merran_AnyFriendly","You, too!"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_1_Beryl_NPC","Well, if it isn't our brave saviors."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_2_Any_Default","Good day, Lieutenant."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_3_Aristocrat_Formal","Salutations, Lieutenant."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_4_Beryl_NPC","I'm no longer a lieutenant. I resigned my commission. I work for my people now."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_5_Any_Default","The Snow Alliance?"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_6_Beryl_NPC","I will never step foot in the Badlands again."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_7_Any_Default","I understand your reluctance."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_8_Loyalty_Normal","Yes, well, you clearly weren't cut out for that posting."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_9_Beryl_NPC","I've made my peace, but you aren't here to check on my welfare, are you?"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_10_Any_Formal","No, we seek information. Before the attack, where exactly did your scout venture?"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_11_Any_Normal","No, we have questions. Your scout? Do you know where he was before the attack? "
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_12_Beryl_NPC","You mean Daliat?"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_13_Any_Formal","Yes, we'd like to know where he went before the Soraks attacked."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_14_Any_Normal","Right, Daliat. Where did he go before the Soraks attacked?"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_15_Beryl_NPC","As far as I know, there's not a name for that place or a road that leads there…"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_16_Beryl_NPC","But I can show you on a map. It's near the ruins of an ancient tower."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_17_Aristocrat_Formal","You have our gratitude, Lady Stonebeard."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_18_Any_Default","Thank you, Beryl. We appreciate the help."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_19_Beryl_NPC","What are you thanking me for? Sending you to your death?"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_1_Daliat_NPC","Greetings, deputies."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_2_Spy_Normal","Are you ready to come clean?"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_3_Any_Default","Greetings, Daliat. If that's even your name."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_4_Daliat_NPC","Of course it's my name. What are you implying?"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_5_Any_Default","Nothing at all. We just want to establish who we're talking to."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_6_Daliat_NPC","Daliat Sunbird, Scout of the Council. You know who I am!"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_7_Any_Default","Then perhaps you can tell us the location of the ruin you came across right before the Soraks attacked."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_8_Daliat_NPC","What do you mean?"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_9_Spy_Normal","Tell us all you know and perhaps we can convince the Council to go easy on you."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_10_Daliat_NPC","Why would they need to go easy on me? I've told you all I know."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_11_Spy_Normal","You haven't told us the location of the Manacalon ruin you found right before the Soraks attacked."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_12_Daliat_NPC","I won't take you there…"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_13_Daliat_NPC","But I can show you the location on a map."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_14_Daliat_NPC","Of course, nothing is free."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_15_Any_Default","Indeed. Thank you."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_16_Daliat_NPC","I'm glad we could come to some agreement."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_17_Any_Default","As are we."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_18_Daliat_NPC","It's just business, after all."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_19_Any_Default","Right, nothing personal. Take care, Daliat."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_1_Robar_NPC","Well, look who it is. I see you survived the Council."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_2_Any_Default","We did indeed."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_3_Sellsword_Normal","Don't get your hopes up. We aren't here to offer you a job."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_4_Robar_NPC","Good, because I imagine you'd probably pay very poorly."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_5_Sellsword_Normal","You imagine correctly. I do have a question, though."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_6_Robar_NPC","To what do I owe the honor?"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_7_Any_Default","We'd like to know where Daliat and his scouts ventured right before the attack."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_8_Robar_NPC","Looking for Soraks, are we?"
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_9_Any_Default","Possibly."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_10_Robar_NPC","You people are crazy."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_11_Robar_NPC","Here, gimme your map and I'll pinpoint the approximate location."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_12_Robar_NPC","It's near an old ruin, an ancient tower."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_13_Any_Default","Appreciate the help, Robar."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_14_Robar_NPC","Though I may have just helped you into an early grave."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_15_Any_Default","This time we'll take them by surprise."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_16_Robar_NPC","Right. Good luck with that."
"Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_17_Any_Default","Farewell, Robar!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_1_Starter_Formal","What is this?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_2_Starter_Normal","What's going on here?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_3_Starter_Slang","What the hell did we just stumble into?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_4_Partner_Default","These aren't Soraks. They seem human."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_5_Starter_Default","What exactly are they doing?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_6_Partner_Default","What's it look like they're doing? They're digging something up."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_7_History_Slang","Just another dusty pile of rubble from before the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_8_History_Normal","This ruin dates back to Imperial times."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_8_History_Default","A tower of magic perhaps, owned by one of the masters of Manacalon's Arcaneum."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_9_Starter_Default","Who are these people? Scavengers?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_10_Partner_Default","Hard to say. I see no tent or flag signifying their allegiance."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_11_Authority_Default","Well, there is one way to find out."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_12_Selfpres_Default","Perhaps we should sneak a little closer."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_13_Friendliness_Default","Or simply walk in and see how friendly they are."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers01","Alert!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers02_Normal","All right - no talking, then… "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers03_Formal","Looks like there won't be any parley… "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_1_Starter_Default","So what do you think?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_2_Partner_Normal","Humans."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_3_Partner_Slang","They look like people to me."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_4_Partner_Formal","I see nothing to indicate they are reptilian."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_5_Partner_Normal","Unless, they have been transmogrified and are in disguise."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_6_Starter_Default","What's that symbol there?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_7_Partner_Default","The tattoo?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_8_Partner_Default","Looks like an A."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_9_Commentator_Default","They all have it."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_10_Cynical_Normal","Guess they're all part of the same club."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_11_Cynical_Formal","Perhaps it's a crude marker that indicates their allegiance. "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_12_Pragmatic_Default","Well, there's no reason to assume it signifies something sinister."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_13_Starter_Default","Do you think it has anything to do with the Soraks?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_14_History_Default","""A"" could stand for Arivad."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_15_History_Default","One of the many names of Sorr-Tarr, the Sorak God."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_16_Anyother_Default","Are you kidding me?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_17_Anyother_Default","That's not good."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_18_Starter_Default","At least we know we're in the right place."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_19_Authority_Default","Should we see what they're doing here?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_20_Selpres_Default","Yes, but we should also keep an eye out for any stray Soraks."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_21_Violence_Default","If a Sorak shows up, we need to cut off its head."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_1_Starter_Default","Please don't kill me."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_2_Starter_Default","What are you doing here?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_3_Starter_Default","I'm just a worker."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_4_Starter_Default","Are you tattooed with an A?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_5_Starter_Default","I… you don't understand…"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_6_Starter_Default","Are you one of them?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_7_Starter_Default","One of what? I'm just trying to survive. "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_8_Starter_Default","I had no choice."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_9_Written_Kill","You must die."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_10_Written_LetLive","Get out of here."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_11_Written_Tatoo","Tell us about the tattoo."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_12_Written_Imps","Are the Soraks around?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_13_Choice_Kill","He is a Sorak slave! We should put him out of his misery!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_14_Choice_LetLive","Run! Run for your life! "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_15_Choice_Tatoo","What does the tattoo signify?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_16_Choice_Imps","Are the Soraks close by?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_17_Starter_Default","It's… I can't…"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_18_Starter_Default","He's dead. How is that possible? "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_19_Starter_Default","How is any of this possible?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_20_Starter_Default","He was doomed from the start."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_21_Starter_Default","They're here. They're close…"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_22_Starter_Default","If they know that I…"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor1_Starter_NPC","Another statue… "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor2_Partner_Normal","These guys really loved themselves."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor3_Partner_Formal","These Manacalon wizards were quite fond of themselves."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor4_History_Normal","Now, this is an Emperor."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor5_History_Normal","A famous one, too? Lerithir Imradir… "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor6_History_Normal","…he was Emperor at the time of the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor7_Partner_Normal","Good job managing the trouble, mister."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor8_Partner_Formal","He made history, but not the way he would have wanted."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_1_Arcana_Default","This place is astounding."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_2_Partner_Default","What kind of runes are those?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_3_Arcana_Default","Enchanted runes. From the ancient Imperial period. "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_4_Arcana_Default","It is said they had eight schools of magic."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_5_Arcana_Default","Each is represented here. All as equals."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_6_Pragmatic_Formal","We weren't sent here to find runes. We were sent to find Soraks. "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_7_Pragmatic_Slang","Yeah, you can tell that to the Soraks right before they cut us to frickin' pieces."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_8_Pragmatic_Normal","We're not here for runes, we're here for Soraks."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_1_Starter_Default","That was… unexpected."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_2_Partner_Default","This place is topsy-turvy."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_3_Partner_Default","Magic from a time long forgotten. "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_4_Joker_Default","Remind me not to take a dump in that hole."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_5_Prag_Default","Do you really have to make jokes?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_6_Joker_Default","Yeah. It's in my contract. Did Carran not tell you?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_7_FormalJoker_Default","Something funny suddenly comes to mind…"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_8_Prag_Default","Can you keep it to yourself?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_9_Starter_Default","Might be good to remember what these blue currents can do."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_1_Starter_Default","We did it!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_2_Partner_Default","Was that insane puzzle the work of some long dead Manacalon wizard?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_3_Joke_Default","Probably. Even from the tomb that magical arsehole is messing with us.  "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_1_Starter_Default","They didn't die easily."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_2_Starter_Default","Worthy foes, indeed."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_3_Partner_Formal","Thankfully, we prevailed."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_4_Partner_Slang","Got every one of those ugly bastards."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_5_Partner_Normal","They bleed just like we do."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_6_Pragmatic_Default","Now we just need one of their bloody heads."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_1_Commentator_Default","Would you look at this?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_2_Starter_Default","A crown of some kind?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_3_Partner_Default","They seemed to keep their distance from it."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_4_Selpres_Default","Maybe it's cursed."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_5_PlayerChoice_Default","Look what I found."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_6_Educated_Default","Let me take a look."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_7_Default_Default","What language is this?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_8_Tirmarian_Default","Looks like ancient Tirmarian."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_9_Tirmarian_Default","If you find it, send for… this appears to be a name."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_10_Starter_Slang","Is this the language of those damned lizards? "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_11_Starter_Normal","That has to be a Sorak name."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_12_Partner_Default","They were protecting it, so it must be valuable - to them, at least."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_13_Selpres_Default","Take it then. "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_14_Starter_Default","Whew, I was worried it might be booby trapped."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_15_Partner_Default","Perhaps we should rest before we head back."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_16_Selpres_Default","I say we go."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_17_Selpres_Default","Before the owner of that unpronounceable name shows his ugly face."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default","The mission is done after all."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_19_Selpres_Default","Is it? Did someone cut off a Sorak's head?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_20_Selpres_Default","All right, then - I'll do it!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_21_Pragmatic_Default","The sooner we go, the sooner we can get back to Caer Cyflen."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_22_Starter_Default","After you, friends."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrownWRITTENLINE","Take the Crown"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_1_Starter_Default","Interesting."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_2_Spellcaster_Default","It's in remarkable condition considering how long it's been here."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_3_Starter_Default","Do you think it has magical properties?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_4_Spellcaster_Slang","By Arun's bones! I think it's a spellbook."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_5_Spellcaster_Default","A spellbook that predates the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_6_Starter_Default","And I should care because?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_7_Spellcaster_Formal","Who knows what it might contain."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_8_Spellcaster_Default","A long-forgotten spell. A valuable secret."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_9_Spellcaster_Default","But it looks like it's locked."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_10_Starter_Default","Take it. Perhaps someone in Caer Cyflen will know how to open it."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_11_Spellcaster_Default","First things first. We have a mission to complete."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_12_Spellcaster_Formal","Indeed, but we have more pressing matters to attend to first."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_13_Spellcaster_Slang","Yeah, but right now we have more important shit to take care of."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_1_Starter_Default","Fancy."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_2_Starter_Default","Beautiful craftsmanship."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_3_Starter_Default","She looks like an empress."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_4_History_Default","She doesn't bear the proper regalia. Not for a Manacalon."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_5_History_Default","More likely she was a wizard, a master of the Arcaneum."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_6_Starter_Default","Could this have been her home?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_7_History_Default","Possibly."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_8_Joker_Default","If it was, she sure let it go to hell. What a packrat. "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_9_Joker_Default","Her bones are probably buried somewhere under all these frickin' books."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_10_Starter_Default","You are an idiot."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_1_Starter_Default","You see that?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_2_Partner_Default","Is that a Sorak?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_3_History_Default","Don't be ridiculous. This is pre-Cataclysm."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4_History_Default","Before anyone knew what a Sorak even was."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_5_History_Default","It's a dragon."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_6_Starter_Default","It's no bigger than a man."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_7_Starter_Slang","No shit?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_8_Starter_Normal","If you say so."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_9_Partner_Normal","I don't think so."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_1_Starter_Default","Is this one of those rocks that…"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_2_Partner_Default","Nope. This place is insane."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_3_Partner_Default","In the Badlands…"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_4_Starter_Default","I know… expect the unexpected. "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_1_Starter_Default","Well, that didn't do a damn thing. "
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_2_Cynical_Default","Did you really think that would open the door?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_3_Violence_Default","I need to break some frickin' heads!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_4_Pragmatism_Default","We need to be smarter about this. Think it through."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_5_Greed_Default","We better get out of this with some gold in our pockets."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_6_SelfPres_Default","Your faces are not the last faces I want to see."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_1_Starter_Default","Stay hidden. They're here."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_2_Partner_Default","Soraks?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_3_Starter_Default","What else could they be?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_4_Partner_Normal","You ready to do this?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_5_Partner_Formal","This is it, friends. Stay strong."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_6_Starter_Default","Get in position…"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_7_Starter_Default","…hit 'em hard and take 'em by surprise."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_8_Partner_Default","Ready."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_1_Partner_Normal","You look a little pale. Is something wrong?"
"Narration/&CrownOwned_2_Partner_Formal","Are you feeling poorly? You seem a bit pasty-faced."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_3_Bearer_Default","I don't feel too good. "
"Narration/&CrownOwned_4_Cynical_Selfpres_Default","I knew that old Crown was cursed."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_5_Cynical_Selfpres_Slang","Shit, I knew that hunk of junk was cursed."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_6_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal","Just as I feared. The crown is Cursed."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_7_Partner_Default","You don't know that."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_8_Cynical_Selpres_Default","Just get rid of it."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_9_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal","Perhaps we should leave it."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_10_Bearer_Default","No, we need it."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_11_Partner_Default","Need it? For what?"
"Narration/&CrownOwned_12_Bearer_Default","For its power. I can feel it. Deep inside."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_13_Friendly_Default","Are you okay?"
"Narration/&CrownOwned_14_Bearer_Default","I just need to rest for a bit."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_15_Any1_Default","Yeah, I'm not feeling too good either."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_16_Any2_Default","I'm exhausted as well."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_17_Cynical_Selpres_Default","Maybe the curse has affected us all."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_18_Partner_Default","Stop it. Don't be ridiculous."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_19_Friendly_Default","Fine, let's rest for a while. Set up camp."
"Narration/&CrownOwned_20_Friendly_Formal","I propose we set up camp and get some rest."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_1_Pragmatic_Default","We did it! We brought back proof!"
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_2_Pragmatic_Formal","Against all odds, we have recovered proof that Soraks do exist."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_3_Friendly_Default","How do you feel?"
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_4_Bearer_Default","Better."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_5_Friendly_Default","Maybe that sickness was nothing."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_6_Friendly_Formal","It might have been a simple fever, after all."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_7_Pragmatic_Default","What about the Crown?"
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_8_Pragmatic_Default","You know the Council will probably take it."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_9_Bearer_Default","No!"
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_10_Pragmatic_Default","We can't hide the fact that we found it with the Soraks."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_11_Pragmatic_Slang","We can't bullshit them, it's got to be a Sorak thing."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_12_Bearer_Default","It's our loot! Ours!"
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_13_Pragmatic_Default","We have to declare anything of historical value… "
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_14_Pragmatic_Default","…and they have the right to buy it."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_15_Bearer_Default","And if it's priceless?"
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_16_Cynical_Default","Come on! They can do whatever they want."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_17_Bearer_Default","Sure."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default","I guess we'll see."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_19_Pragmatic_Formal","We must wait and see, and hope for the best."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_20_Cynical_Default","Who fought the Soraks - us or them?"
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_21_Cynical_Normal","They'd better remember that we fought the Soraks for this."
"Narration/&BackWithCrown_22_Cynical_Formal","We might want to remind them that they were wrong about the Soraks."
"Narration/&Council02_1_1_Partner_Default","Lord Carran!"
"Narration/&Council02_1_2_Carran_NPC","Ah - deputies! "
"Narration/&Council02_1_2_2_Carran_NPC","I see you found some nice shiny loot."
"Narration/&Council02_1_3_Carran_NPC","So have you brought us the head of a Sorak?"
"Narration/&Council02_1_4_Partner_Default","One head, slightly damaged."
"Narration/&Council02_1_5_Carran_NPC","Maraike preserve us! I'm sorry I asked!"
"Narration/&Council02_1_6_Partner_Default","At least it's dead. You should have seen it alive."
"Narration/&Council02_1_7_Carran_NPC","I can only imagine."
"Narration/&Council02_1_8_Partner_Default","When's the next Council meeting?"
"Narration/&Council02_1_9_Carran_NPC","When? Now, of course!"
"Narration/&Council02_1_10_Carran_NPC","The rumor of your return has already reached the Palace."
"Narration/&Council02_1_11_Carran_NPC","They're waiting for you."
"Narration/&Council02_1_12_Partner_Default","They are?"
"Narration/&Council02_1_13_Carran_NPC","Well, more for… this. But come on!"
"Narration/&Council02_1_14_Merton_NPC","Now, there's a trophy."
"Narration/&Council02_1_15_Merton_NPC","And by the way, who's crazy now?"
"Narration/&Council02_1_16_Default_Default","All right, you were right and we were wrong. They do exist. Happy now?"
"Narration/&Council02_1_17_Merton_NPC","Kid, I've seen more than anyone in this town, yet nobody seems to believe me."
"Narration/&Council02_1_18_Cynical_Default","Maybe it's a curse."
"Narration/&Council02_1_19_Merton_NPC","The curse of being surrounded by idiots… "
"Narration/&Council02_1_20_Carran_NPC","If you don't mind, Merton, we have business to attend to."
"Narration/&Council02_1_21_Merton_NPC","Right. Say hello to the old lady for me, Carran!"
"Narration/&Council02_1_22_Default_Default","Who's this guy again?"
"Narration/&Council02_1_23_Merton_NPC","Arwin Merton. He used to be a legend - the first Scavenger, they say."
"Narration/&Council02_1_24_Merton_NPC","But now - well, you can see for yourself."
"Narration/&Council02_1_25_Curious_Default","Who's this old lady?"
"Narration/&Council02_1_26_Merton_NPC","Just ignore him."
"Narration/&Council02_1_27_Merton_NPC","Let's go."
"Narration/&Council02_2_1_EinarBoss_NPC","Your thoughts, Dean Faisech?"
"Narration/&Council02_2_2_Towerboss_NPC","I… well… it looks very much as the scriptures describe."
"Narration/&Council02_2_3_Danantar_NPC","Well, then - it seems we have a problem."
"Narration/&Council02_2_4_EinarBoss_NPC","It's a disaster! We all know what the Sorr-Akkath did on Tirmar!"
"Narration/&Council02_2_5_Partner_Default","There's something else."
"Narration/&Council02_2_6_Danantar_NPC","What?"
"Narration/&Council02_2_7_Antiquarian_NPC","A Crown?"
"Narration/&Council02_2_8_Towerboss_NPC","Interesting. A very nice find."
"Narration/&Council02_2_9_Partner_Default","We don't want to sell it."
"Narration/&Council02_2_10_Antiquarian_NPC","Why not? You know we pay well."
"Narration/&Council02_2_11_Partner_Default","We want to keep it."
"Narration/&Council02_2_12_Arcaneum_NPC","I'd like to take a look at it, though."
"Narration/&Council02_2_13_Partner_Default","… "
"Narration/&Council02_2_14_Authority_Default","Come on, let them take a look."
"Narration/&Council02_2_15_Arcaneum_NPC","Thank you."
"Narration/&Council02_2_16_Danantar_NPC","Any ideas?"
"Narration/&Council02_2_17_Arcaneum_NPC","It's quite massive… clearly Imperial in style… "
"Narration/&Council02_2_18_Towerboss_NPC","These runes remind me of the Imperial schools of magic… "
"Narration/&Council02_2_19_Antiquarian_NPC","I have a spell I'd like to cast on this."
"Narration/&Council02_2_20_Princess_NPC","My lords! This deputy is clearly unwell!"
"Narration/&Council02_2_21_Danantar_NPC","What?"
"Narration/&Council02_3_1_Bearer_Default","What happened?"
"Narration/&Council02_3_2_Friendly_Default","You passed out."
"Narration/&Council02_3_3_Bearer_Default","Where are we?"
"Narration/&Council02_3_4_Friendly_Default","The Temple of Einar."
"Narration/&Council02_3_5_Friendly_Default","Marshal Beric Sunblaze himself invited us to stay here."
"Narration/&Council02_3_6_Pragmatic_Default","We certainly made an impression on the Council."
"Narration/&Council02_3_7_Pragmatic_Default","They believe you're attuned to the Crown… "
"Narration/&Council02_3_8_Pragmatic_Default","…that you can't be separated from it."
"Narration/&Council02_3_9_Bearer_Default","What? So it is cursed?"
"Narration/&Council02_3_10_Cynical_Default","They're not sure. All these big brains, and they're stumped."
"Narration/&Council02_3_11_Cynical_Default","They cast spells on the crown, on you… "
"Narration/&Council02_3_12_Pragmatic_Default","Between that and the Soraks, we caused quite a fuss out there."
"Narration/&Council02_3_13_Pragmatic_Default","They'll reconvene the Council when you're ready."
"Narration/&Council02_3_14_Pragmatic_Default","But trust me, there's a lot of people who want to talk to you first."
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","It's an honor, deputies."
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default","Who are you?"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_3_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","My name is Maddy Greenisle. I work for the Tower of Knowledge."
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_4_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","I'm just a junior aide in the Council…"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_5_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","…but if you ever need to contact my superiors without going through official channels…"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","…just see me at the Tower, downtown."
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Selfpres_Default","Why the sudden interest in us?"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_8_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","You proved yourselves in the Badlands…"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_9_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","…and we in the Tower of Knowledge value skilled adventurers."
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_10_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","If you find anything of historical value, we'll pay well…"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_11_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","And if things go well, we might share some of our own secrets."
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_12_Authority_Default","All right - we'll think about it."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_1_HalmanSummer_NPC","Greetings, Sorak slayers!"
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_2_Friendly_Default","Hello."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_3_HalmanSummer_NPC","I am Halman Summer of the Guild of Antiquarians."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_4_HalmanSummer_NPC","I am instructed to invite you to visit us at the Embassy of the Snow Alliance."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_5_Lawfulness_Default","You're based at an embassy? I thought the Council was neutral."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_6_HalmanSummer_NPC","We don't have a house of our own in Caer Cyflen - unlike the Tower of Knowledge…"
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_7_HalmanSummer_NPC","…how about that for neutrality?"
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_8_HalmanSummer_NPC","Anyway, we'd be interested in any antiquities you might bring back. "
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_9_HalmanSummer_NPC","We pay very well, even for things you might think are worthless."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_10_Cynical_Default","Like the Scavengers?"
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_11_HalmanSummer_NPC","The Scavengers? They'd sell an antique Emperor's sword for its metal value."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_12_HalmanSummer_NPC","But we can offer more than gold."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_13_HalmanSummer_NPC","Antique magical items, for instance. You'll never find their like elsewhere."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_14_Friendly_Default","Good to know. Thanks for the invitation."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Can I ask for a minute of your time, deputies?"
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_2_Player_Authority","We're in kind of a hurry."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I know. I won't delay you long."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_4_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","My name is Heddlon Surespell. I represent the Arcaneum."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_5_AnyNotElf_Default","And the Arcaneum belongs to the New Empire. Do you really want to be seen talking to us?"
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","My business is magic, not politics. And no, I have no quarrel with you."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","You may not see us Imperials as friends, but we take the Council very seriously."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_8_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","We are particularly interested in anything from the Old Empire that you might find in the Badlands."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Anything from the Manacalon-era Arcaneum, even more so."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_10_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Of course we'd pay you handsomely for this Crown, but I know that is not possible."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default","You're smarter than you look."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Also quite indifferent to mockery."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_13_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Anyway, we have an unrivaled trove of magical and other knowledge."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_14_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Think it over. You can find me at the Gravekeep's Cask."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_15_Lawful_Default","Really? Not at the embassy?"
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","What can I say? I love Martel's beer. Even though it tastes like donkey piss…"
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_17_Selfpres_Default","What? How did he… ?"
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_18_Selfpres_Default","That was our joke, the first day we met. Was he spying on us?"
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_19_Pragmatic_Default","Maybe he just agrees about the taste."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Would you have a moment, deputies?"
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default","All right, but make it quick."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_3_JorielFoxeye_NPC","I'll do my best."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_4_JorielFoxeye_NPC","I am Joriel Foxeye, from the Circle of Danantar."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_5_Nosy_Default","The same magic school where the Princess studies?"
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_6_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Exactly. "
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Default","Is she a good student? A powerful wizard?"
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_8_JorielFoxeye_NPC","That's not for me to say - and you seemed to be in a rush?"
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_9_Nosy_Default","Fine."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_10_JorielFoxeye_NPC","I just want you to know that our grand master Edvan Danantar has noticed you."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default","He talked a lot, for sure."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_12_JorielFoxeye_NPC","He's a man of great authority."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_JorielFoxeye_NPC","He'd like you to know that our doors are open to you if you'd care to visit us."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC","You can find me at Sunblaze Court."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_14_Pragmatic_Default","Interested in Badlands treasures, I suppose, like everyone else?"
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_15_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Well, if you ever come across old spellbooks or spell scrolls, we'd love to see them."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_16_JorielFoxeye_NPC","In return, we have the largest collection of spells and potion recipes you could ever hope to see."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_17_Nosy_Default","More than the Arcaneum?"
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_18_JorielFoxeye_NPC","They would disagree - but yes."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_19_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Now, if you were to prefer feeding the New Empire's wizards with more magical knowledge than the Principality…"
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_20_JorielFoxeye_NPC","…that would be troubling to many on the Council."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_21_Lawful_Default","Neutrality means we don't treat you any differently than we treat them."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_22_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Of course. Neutrality is the rule."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_23_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Good day to you, deputies."
"Narration/&Council02_4_1_TowerBoss_NPC","Ah - our crownbearer is up again!"
"Narration/&Council02_4_2_Speaker_NPC","Honorable Council Members! Please take your seats!"
"Narration/&Council02_4_3_Speaker_NPC","Lord Danantar has the floor."
"Narration/&Council02_4_4_Danantar_NPC","Thank you."
"Narration/&Council02_4_5_Danantar_NPC","I have confirmed that our deputy is indeed magically attuned to the Crown."
"Narration/&Council02_4_6_Danantar_NPC","It is… an uncommonly powerful attunement, unlike anything I've seen."
"Narration/&Council02_4_7_Danantar_NPC","I strongly recommend against forcing a separation."
"Narration/&Council02_4_8_Speaker_NPC","Chancellor Gormsdottir?"
"Narration/&Council02_4_9_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","With the Council's permission, I'd like to try a little experiment."
"Narration/&Council02_4_10_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","I have here the gem that Captain Merran recovered recently."
"Narration/&Council02_4_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","I have reason to believe that it might be… "
"Narration/&Council02_4_12_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","As I suspected! It belongs to the Crown!"
"Narration/&Council02_4_13_Arcaneum_NPC","What have you done?"
"Narration/&Council02_4_14_EinarBoss_NPC","Commander! Take Her Royal Highness to safety!"
"Narration/&Council02_4_15_Princess_NPC","Wait!"
"Narration/&Council02_5_1_Arcaneum_NPC","Are you going to faint again?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_2_Crownbearer_WRITTEN","I just had a… vision, I guess it was."
"Narration/&Council02_5_3_Crownbearer_WRITTEN","It's nothing."
"Narration/&Council02_5_4_Crownbearer_WRITTEN","I must… find the other gems."
"Narration/&Council02_5_5_Crownbearer_Answer","I just had a vision."
"Narration/&Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Answer","It's nothing."
"Narration/&Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Answer","The Crown wants the other gems back."
"Narration/&Council02_5_5_Danantar_NPC","A vision? In an instant?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Default","I was fighting Soraks - but I wasn't myself."
"Narration/&Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Default","Then… who were you?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_8_Crownbearer_Default","A paladin… powerful… "
"Narration/&Council02_5_9_Crownbearer_Default","…from Tirmar."
"Narration/&Council02_5_10_Danantar_NPC","That is… unsettling."
"Narration/&Council02_5_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","Honorable delegates, I suggest we focus on the Soraks for now."
"Narration/&Council02_5_12_Danantar_NPC","I concur."
"Narration/&Council02_5_13_EinarBoss_NPC","What about this artifact? The other gems?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_14_TowerBoss_NPC","What?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_15_Crownbearer_Default","I think I can find them. I can… feel them."
"Narration/&Council02_5_16_EinarBoss_NPC","You said it wasn't sentient."
"Narration/&Council02_5_17_Danantar_NPC","This is old Manacalon magic. Anything is possible."
"Narration/&Council02_5_18_Danantar_NPC","Let the crownbearer and the other deputies follow that quest."
"Narration/&Council02_5_19_Danantar_NPC","Find the other gems if you can, but keep us informed."
"Narration/&Council02_5_20_Danantar_NPC","In the meantime, we will formulate a response to the Soraks."
"Narration/&Council02_5_21_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","Let's vote. Delegates - do you agree?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_22_All_NPC","Aye!"
"Narration/&Council02_5_23_Speaker_NPC","Your Royal Highness?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_24_Princess_NPC","Oh? pardon me. Yes, I concur… "
"Narration/&Council02_5_25_Speaker_NPC","To which proposition, Your Highness?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_26_Princess_NPC","I mean, aye. They should go and find the diamonds - the gems."
"Narration/&Council02_5_27_Speaker_NPC","So resolved! Let it be recorded!"
"Narration/&Council02_5_28_Speaker_NPC","Thank you, honored delegates. The Council is now in recess."
"Narration/&Council02_5_29_Char1_Default","What was that?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_30_Char1_Default","You had a vision?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_31_Char2_Default","What do you mean the Crown wants its missing gems?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_32_Crownbearer_Default","I… I can't explain. I just feel it. Anyway, we have a new mission."
"Narration/&Council02_5_33_Char3_Default","All right, then. So where are we going, crownbearer?"
"Narration/&Council02_5_34_Crownbearer_Default","I think… the Crown knows."
"Narration/&Merton_01_1_Merton_NPC","Look who's here! The Sorak hunters themselves!"
"Narration/&Merton_01_2_Any_Default","It's Merton, right? Arwin Merton?"
"Narration/&Merton_01_3_Merton_NPC","Damn right!"
"Narration/&Merton_01_4_Any_Default","First Scavenger? Where does that come from?"
"Narration/&Merton_01_5_Merton_NPC","Long story, kid."
"Narration/&Merton_01_6_Merton_NPC","Short version: When we started crossing the Marches to the Badlands, I was one of the first."
"Narration/&Merton_01_7_Merton_NPC","Now, I'm just the ugliest one still standing."
"Narration/&Merton_01_8_Any_Default","What should we know about the Badlands? Any advice?"
"Narration/&Merton_01_9_Merton_NPC","Bring a good cleric with good healing spells. You'll need them."
"Narration/&Merton_01_10_Any_Default","You're a legend. Why do you seem so sour?"
"Narration/&Merton_01_11_Merton_NPC","Sour? It's this ale that's sour, that's all."
"Narration/&Merton_01_12_Merton_NPC","The high and mighty Council, paying clueless kids like you to go and get killed in the Badlands."
"Narration/&Merton_01_13_Merton_NPC","But they're not asking good old Arwin - nooo. Go figure."
"Narration/&Merton_01_14_Merton_NPC","It's because I got them figured out."
"Narration/&Merton_01_15_Any_Default","Figured out how?"
"Narration/&Merton_01_16_Merton_NPC","This Legacy Council is full of it."
"Narration/&Merton_01_17_Merton_NPC","Acting all united and lovey-dovey while they plot to rob each other."
"Narration/&Merton_01_18_Merton_NPC","Wouldn't surprise me if some of them were even Soraks in disguise. You know they can shapeshift."
"Narration/&Merton_01_19_Any_Default","Uh - okay…"
"Narration/&Merton_01_20_Merton_NPC","Hey, I was right about them hiding in the Badlands, wasn't I?"
"Narration/&Council03_1_LeiraKean_NPC","Honorable members of the Council, please be seated!"
"Narration/&Council03_2_LeiraKean_NPC","The Legacy Council is now in session!"
"Narration/&Council03_3_LeiraKean_NPC","Lord Keenmind has the floor."
"Narration/&Council03_4_Keenmind_NPC","Honorable members of the Council, we at the Arcaneum… "
"Narration/&Council03_5_Keenmind_NPC","…have gathered crucial information about this Crown."
"Narration/&Council03_6_Keenmind_NPC","This is indeed the Crown of the Magister, belonging to Kaseinax, Eternal Soul of the Eight Traditions… "
"Narration/&Council03_7_Keenmind_NPC","…ninth and last Magister of the Manacalon Arcaneum."
"Narration/&Council03_8_Keenmind_NPC","At the time, there were eight masters of magic, one for each of the old schools."
"Narration/&Council03_9_Keenmind_NPC","In time of need, each of the masters lent their gem to the Magister, the head of the Arcaneum."
"Narration/&Council03_10_Keenmind_NPC","Placed in the Crown, they granted additional powers… "
"Narration/&Council03_11_Keenmind_NPC","…that enabled the Magister to cast spells or perform rituals of incredible power."
"Narration/&Council03_12_Keenmind_NPC","Such as the closing of the Rift from Tirmar."
"Narration/&Council03_13_All_NPC","overlapping murmurs"
"Narration/&Council03_14_Keenmind_NPC","Indeed."
"Narration/&Council03_15_Keenmind_NPC","Now… there is some debate about… "
"Narration/&Council03_16_Keenmind_NPC","…whether the Crown, with all its gems… "
"Narration/&Council03_17_Keenmind_NPC","…could possibly open another Rift…"
"Narration/&Council03_18_All_NPC","overlapping protestations"
"Narration/&Council03_19_Keenmind_NPC","…or even reopen the previous one."
"Narration/&Council03_20_Towerboss_NPC","Nonsense! The Rift has been closed for a millennium!"
"Narration/&Council03_21_Danantar_NPC","Solasta paid a high enough price for that!"
"Narration/&Council03_22_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Have you been to the Badlands recently?"
"Narration/&Council03_23_LeiraKean_NPC","Order!"
"Narration/&Council03_24_LeiraKean_NPC","Marshal Sunblaze has the floor."
"Narration/&Council03_25_Einarboss_NPC","For our part, now that the existence of Sorr-Akkath on Solasta has been confirmed…"
"Narration/&Council03_26_Einarboss_NPC","…we have gathered proof that they are operating everywhere in the Eastern Kingdoms."
"Narration/&Council03_27_Einarboss_NPC","Including here, in the Principality of Masgarth."
"Narration/&Council03_28_Towerboss_NPC","Impossible!"
"Narration/&Council03_29_Einarboss_NPC","The Soraks are looking for the Crown and its gems. That cannot be a coincidence."
"Narration/&Council03_30_Antiquariansboss_NPC","A powerful artifact, certainly - but reopening the Rift? "
"Narration/&Council03_31_Antiquariansboss_NPC","It took all the gods of Tirmar to open it!"
"Narration/&Council03_32_Einarboss_NPC","No one knows for sure what the Crown can do."
"Narration/&Council03_33_Keenmind_NPC","It's a theory."
"Narration/&Council03_34_Keenmind_NPC","As you know, it protects itself from our divination spells… "
"Narration/&Council03_35_Keenmind_NPC","…that is one of its mysterious powers."
"Narration/&Council03_36_Towerboss_NPC","Then why would the Soraks think they know better?"
"Narration/&Council03_37_Einarboss_NPC","Because they're Soraks!"
"Narration/&Council03_38_Einarboss_NPC","Their people, their culture - they must have been obsessing about this for a thousand years!"
"Narration/&Council03_39_Einarboss_NPC","While we spent that time fighting each other, they had to stick together and hide to survive."
"Narration/&Council03_40_Towerboss_NPC","Fables and conjectures!"
"Narration/&Council03_41_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Perhaps."
"Narration/&Council03_42_Einarboss_NPC","But can we take the risk?"
"Narration/&Council03_43_Danantar_NPC","The Crown must be secured!"
"Narration/&Council03_44_Antiquariansboss_NPC","The Crown belongs to those who found it. Those are the rules."
"Narration/&Council03_45_Antiquariansboss_NPC","The quest for the gems should be completed."
"Narration/&Council03_46_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Only this way can we learn more about the Crown and its powers."
"Narration/&Council03_47_Towerboss_NPC","These deputies - well, they're not strong enough! No offense."
"Narration/&Council03_48_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Tell that to the Crown. And they've done well enough so far, wouldn't you say?"
"Narration/&Council03_49_Towerboss_NPC","This is nonsense!"
"Narration/&Council03_50_Princess_NPC","Maybe the deputies would like to speak."
"Narration/&Council03_51_Princess_NPC","After all, they are members of the Council now, aren't they?"
"Narration/&Council03_52_Authority_Normal_WRITTEN","We'll continue the quest."
"Narration/&Council03_55_Greed_Default_WRITTEN","Give us weapons."
"Narration/&Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default_WRITTEN","You should trust us more."
"Narration/&Council03_61_Selfishness_Default_WRITTEN","The Crown is ours."
"Narration/&Council03_52_Authority_Normal","We feel perfectly able to continue searching for the gems."
"Narration/&Council03_53_Authority_Formal","With all due respect, we are confident that we can fulfill this quest ourselves."
"Narration/&Council03_54_Authority_Slang","We got this. Really, it's under control."
"Narration/&Council03_55_Greed_Default","You can give us the means to be stronger. Weapons, armor, maybe some spells?"
"Narration/&Council03_56_Greed_Formal","May we be so bold as to ask your for material support? Weapons, armor, or spells, for instance?"
"Narration/&Council03_57_Greed_Slang","We'd be stronger if you tossed a few things our way. You know - weapons, armor, spells - that sort of thing."
"Narration/&Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default","You may trust that we are devoted to this quest. We are well aware of its importance."
"Narration/&Council03_59_Lawfulness_Formal","We are fully devoted to the quest, and perfectly aware of its vital importance."
"Narration/&Council03_60_Lawfulness_Slang","We get it - this is big. We won't let you down!"
"Narration/&Council03_61_Selfishness_Default","We didn't change our mind about the Crown - it's ours!"
"Narration/&Council03_62_Selfishness_Formal","We must reiterate that we have no intention of giving up the Crown."
"Narration/&Council03_63_Selfishness_Slang","Let's be clear. The Crown is ours, and it stays ours."
"Narration/&Council03_64_Danantar_NPC","Confidence? I like that."
"Narration/&Council03_65_Towerboss_NPC","Preposterous!"
"Narration/&Council03_66_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Five more gems to find. Do you even have a lead?"
"Narration/&Council03_67_Authority_Default","Yes - the best lead possible. The Crown itself tells us where to go."
"Narration/&Council03_68_Einarboss_Default","The Soraks will come after you - you know that?"
"Narration/&Council03_69_Einarboss_Default","But you have our complete support in this struggle."
"Narration/&Council03_70_Friendliness_Formal","Our thanks, Marshal."
"Narration/&Council03_71_Friendliness_Normal","Thanks."
"Narration/&Council03_72_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Don't overestimate yourselves, deputies!"
"Narration/&Council03_73_Einarboss_NPC","That's right! We can't risk the Soraks overpowering them and taking the Crown!"
"Narration/&Council03_74_Danantar_NPC","Well, you're welcome to provide them with whatever weapons and armors you like, Marshal."
"Narration/&Council03_75_Greed_Default","We're just trying to increase our chance of success."
"Narration/&Council03_76_Towerboss_NPC","Of course you are."
"Narration/&Council03_77_Keenmind_NPC","We might have a few spells that can increase your chance of… survival."
"Narration/&Council03_78_Danantar_NPC","Trust is a hot topic, these days."
"Narration/&Council03_73_Einarboss_trust_NPC","Nobody here questions your dedication. You've done a lot already."
"Narration/&Council03_71_Einarboss_NPC","Yet, we should support you in your efforts."
"Narration/&Council03_72_Keenmind_NPC","And we will."
"Narration/&Council03_73_Antiquariansboss_NPC","You understand, though - it is your responsibility to keep the Crown out of the wrong hands?"
"Narration/&Council03_74_Selfishness_Default","The Crown chose us. I doubt it would do any good to anyone else."
"Narration/&Council03_75_Keenmind_NPC","Oh, so you're experts in Manacalon sorcery now?"
"Narration/&Council03_76_Einarboss_NPC","I can only concur. You have a responsibility, and it's more important than ownership."
"Narration/&Council03_77_LeiraKean_NPC","If that is all, may we conclude?"
"Narration/&Council03_78_Princess_NPC","I'd like to say a word, if that is appropriate."
"Narration/&Council03_79_LeiraKean_NPC","Of course, Your Highness. We are listening."
"Narration/&Council03_80_Princess_NPC","I think our brave deputies shouldn't be, you know, sleeping in a… city inn."
"Narration/&Council03_81_Princess_NPC","We have a very comfortable residence near the Palace. "
"Narration/&Council03_82_Princess_NPC","They would be safer there, don't you think?"
"Narration/&Council03_83_Princess_NPC","That would be my - I mean, our - part in supporting the quest."
"Narration/&Council03_84_LeiraKean_NPC","Ahem - Your Highness?"
"Narration/&Council03_85_LeiraKean_NPC","I must remind you that your decisions as head of state are not subject to Council approval."
"Narration/&Council03_86_Princess_NPC","Oh! Right…"
"Narration/&Council03_87_LeiraKean_NPC","Might I suggest that you reiterate your offer outside these walls?"
"Narration/&Council03_88_Princess_NPC","Of course. I beg the Council's pardon."
"Narration/&Council03_89_LeiraKean_NPC","Not at all, Your Highness."
"Narration/&Council03_90_Danantar_NPC","Then I think that is all?"
"Narration/&Council03_91_LeiraKean_NPC","Thank you. The Legacy Council is now in recess."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_1_Captain_NPC","A word, please, deputies?"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Default","Sure."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Formal","Of course."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Slang","What's up?"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_3_Captain_NPC","Her Royal Highness asked me to reiterate her offer to accommodate you at the Palace Residence."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Default","What's that?"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Formal","I'm not sure what that is."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_5_Captain_NPC","A house for plenipotentiaries, emissaries, and other guests of the Court."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Default","Sounds nice."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Formal","It's an honor!"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_7_Captain_NPC","You don't say?"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_8_Any_Default","Where is this residence?"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_9_Captain_NPC","In the Palace. Ask for Ravensworth, the royal butler. He'll show you."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_10_Captain_NPC","Oh, another thing…"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_11_Any_Default","Yes?"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_12_Captain_NPC","I am to give this to any senior deputy of the Council."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_13_Any_Default","What's this?"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_14_Captain_NPC","A command word, to teleport your party to the city's Imperial Gate."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_15__Any_Default","Teleport?"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_16_Any_Default","We can't do that, I'm pretty sure."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_17_Captain_NPC","Well, word is that in the Badlands…"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_18_Captain_NPC","…you may come across functioning Major Gates."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_19_Captain_NPC","If you do, use this command word and you'll be brought back here."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_20_Captain_NPC","Take note of any command word on the Gate you find…"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_21_Captain_NPC","…and you'll be able to return there the same way."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_22_Any_Default","That's fantastic!"
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_23_Captain_NPC","Don't get too excited."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_24_Captain_NPC","So far, no one's found any."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_25_Any_Default","Oh. Right. Thanks anyway."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_26_Captain_NPC","Stay in the light, senior deputies."
"Narration/&HostOfPrincess_27_Any_Default","You too, Captain."
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_1_DalonLark_NPC","Clear skies, adventurers!"
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_2_EinarWorshipper_Default","Fire to your blade!"
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_3_DalonLark_NPC","One of the faithful, I see. Nice to meet you!"
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_4_DalonLark_NPC","I am Chaplain Dalon Lark."
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_5_DalonLark_NPC","You may come here at any time to seek the help of the Church."
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_6_AnyBeliever_Einar","That is good to know, Chaplain!"
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_7_NonBeliever_Default","Hello!"
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_8_AnyBeliever_Default","What do you do here?"
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_9_DalonLark_NPC","I represent the Church of Einar, the god of valor and fidelity."
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_10_DalonLark_NPC","We provide various services for those who need them."
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_11_Cynical_Default","And can pay for them?"
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_12_DalonLark_NPC","Those who seek his healing are rarely poor."
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_13_Any_Default","We do require your services."
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default","Thank you - we need to go."
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_15_DalonLark_NPC","Stay in the light, adventurers!"
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ExitLine","We should go."
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ShopLine","We need your services."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Clear skies, adventurers!"
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_2_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Anything new for the Arcaneum?"
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang","Check this out!"
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default","Possibly."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang","Just passing by."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","That's nice of you."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Stay in the light!"
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_Exitline","Just passing by."
"Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_Offer","Let's talk business!"
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Deputies."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Do you have anything for the Circle?"
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_3_Any_Default","Take a look."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_4_Any_Formal","We might."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_5_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Not really. Just stopped by to say hello."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_6_Any_Default","It's an honor. "
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_7_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Stay in the light, deputies!"
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_Exitline","Just saying hello."
"Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_Offer","What about this?"
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_1_HalmanSummer_NPC","Clear skies, my friends!"
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_2_HalmanSummer_NPC","You have some treasure in your backpacks?"
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang","Feast your eyes on this!"
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default","See what you think of this."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_5_HalmanSummer_NPC","Just passing by to say hello."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_6_HalmanSummer_NPC","Ah, well. It was good to see you."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_7_HalmanSummer_NPC","See you next time, friends!"
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_ExitLine","Just passing by."
"Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_Offer","What about this?"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","Deputies! How are you today?"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_2_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","Do you have some lovely loot from the Badlands?"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang","How 'bout that?"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default","Indeed."
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang","Just missed your smiling face, Miss Greenisle!"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","Such nice manners! All too rare, these days."
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_7_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","Clear skies to you!"
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_Exitline","Just missed you."
"Narration/&Tower_Dialog_Offer","How about that?"
"Narration/&Council4_1_LeiraKean_NPC","Honorable delegates, please be seated!"
"Narration/&Council4_2_LeiraKean_NPC","The Legacy Council is now in session!"
"Narration/&Council4_3_Danantar_NPC","Ah - senior deputies! What news is there?"
"Narration/&Council4_4_Authority_Normal","We're stuck, my lord."
"Narration/&Council4_5_Authority_Formal","My lord, I'm afraid the situation is less than ideal."
"Narration/&Council4_6_Authority_Slang","It's not good news, my Lord."
"Narration/&Council4_7_Faisech_NPC","Meaning what, exactly?"
"Narration/&Council4_10_Faisech_NPC","Perhaps they've been destroyed."
"Narration/&Council4_11_Keenmind_NPC","We tested the first one - it can't be done!"
"Narration/&Council4_12_Danantar_NPC","They must be magically concealed."
"Narration/&Council4_13_Sunblaze_NPC","So the Crown must remain incomplete?"
"Narration/&Council4_14_Gormsdottir_NPC","Maybe the Soraks have the missing gems."
"Narration/&Council4_15_Gormsdottir_NPC","After all, they attacked you more than once. They're clearly still after the Crown."
"Narration/&Council4_16_Faisech_NPC","If you can't find the gems, why keep the Crown out there?"
"Narration/&Council4_17_Faisech_NPC","It will keep attracting the Soraks."
"Narration/&Council4_18_Danantar_NPC","The attunement, remember?"
"Narration/&Council4_19_Faisech_NPC","I'm sorry, senior deputies, but despite the attunement…"
"Narration/&Council4_20_Faisech_NPC","…I believe the Crown should be secured…"
"Narration/&Council4_21_Faisech_NPC","…and secured by more than four adventurers who spend their nights camped in the Badlands!"
"Narration/&Council4_22_Sunblaze_NPC","We can't do that to them! They have served the Council faithfully!"
"Narration/&Council4_23_Faisech_NPC","Don't be naive! We are facing a major threat!"
"Narration/&Council4_24_Faisech_NPC","You understand the meaning of sacrifice, and so should they!"
"Narration/&Council4_25_Authority_Normal","We have searched the Badlands for these gems, at our own risk."
"Narration/&Council4_26_Crownbearer_Normal","We trusted you to keep your word and leave us the Crown."
"Narration/&Council4_27_Danantar_NPC","If I may, I think we need more time to consider the situation."
"Narration/&Council4_28_Faisech_NPC","More time? How much time?"
"Narration/&Council4_29_Danantar_NPC","Maybe just… give it a night."
"Narration/&Council4_30_Gormsdottir_NPC","I could use the day to consult with my people."
"Narration/&Council4_31_Keenmind_NPC","So could I."
"Narration/&Council4_32_Danantar_NPC","Fine, then! Anyone against?"
"Narration/&Council4_33_LeiraKean_NPC","Thank you, Lord Danantar."
"Narration/&Council4_34_LeiraKean_NPC","The Legacy Council is now adjourned!"
"Narration/&Council4_35_Selfpres_Normal","I have a bad feeling about this."
"Narration/&Council4_36_Crownbearer_Normal","I knew it! They'll take the Crown, and never mind what that does to me!"
"Narration/&Council4_37_Crownbearer_Slang","Typical! Sat there on their pretty chairs… doesn't matter if I die!"
"Narration/&Council4_38_Authority_Normal","This is wrong."
"Narration/&Council4_39_Selfpres_Normal","We could run."
"Narration/&Council4_40_Authority_Normal","What's the point? We know what's at stake."
"Narration/&Council4_41_Crownbearer_Normal","They're right about one thing."
"Narration/&Council4_42_Crownbearer_Normal","The Soraks will keep coming after us. After the Crown."
"Narration/&Council4_43_Authority_Normal","We could retrace our steps - go back to where we found the gems. Perhaps there's a trail we overlooked."
"Narration/&Council4_44_Crownbearer_Normal","There's nothing anymore - I can't feel another gem anywhere!"
"Narration/&Council4_45_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Excuse me, senior deputies."
"Narration/&Council4_46_Highclass_Formal","Master Surespell."
"Narration/&Council4_47_Any_Normal","Clear skies, Heddlon."
"Narration/&Council4_48_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I would advise you to avoid the Palace Residence tonight."
"Narration/&Council4_49_Crownbearer_Normal","What? Why?"
"Narration/&Council4_50_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I'm not at liberty to say… just trust me."
"Narration/&Council4_51_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","You have your lodgings at the Gravekeep's Cask. You should spend the night there."
"Narration/&Council4_52_Selfpres_Normal","What kind of advice is that?"
"Narration/&Council4_53_Selfpres_Formal","You must realize your suggestion is… unusual. Suspicious, even."
"Narration/&Council4_54_Selfpres_Slang","Are you crazy? Or are you up to something?"
"Narration/&Council4_55_Nosy_Normal","Are you really working for the Arcaneum? "
"Narration/&Council4_56_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Why else would I be here?"
"Narration/&Council4_57_Mean_Normal","This elf is…"
"Narration/&Council4_58_Lawful_Normal","What do you think?"
"Narration/&Council4_59_Pragmatic_Normal","It sounds like a warning."
"Narration/&Council4_60_Selfpres_Normal","Or a threat!"
"Narration/&Council4_61_Lawful_Normal","Can we trust him?"
"Narration/&Council4_62_Carver_Normal","Trust the New Empire?"
"Narration/&Council4_63_Greed_Normal","I have no idea what to do, but I'd like to sleep in a bed tonight."
"Narration/&Council4_64_Cynical_Normal","I miss Karel's beer."
"Narration/&Council4_65_Any4_Normal","And Merton's sweet talk."
"Narration/&Council4_66_Cynical_Normal","I'd prefer the residence."
"Narration/&Council4_67_Cynical_Normal","I like Captain Ironshell kissing me goodnight."
"Narration/&Council4_68_Authority_Normal","Maybe in your dreams."
"Narration/&NightAttack_1_Selfpres_Default","Soraks - here?"
"Narration/&NightAttack_2_Selfpres_Slang","Soraks! Right here in our damn room!"
"Narration/&NightAttack_3_Selfpres_Formal","The Sorr-Akkath in the palace residence!"
"Narration/&NightAttack_4_Pragmatic_Default","We were warned."
"Narration/&NightAttack_5_Nosy_Default","Surespell? How did he know?"
"Narration/&NightAttack_6_Nosy_Default","Why would he know what the Soraks would do?"
"Narration/&NightAttack_7_Pragmatic_Default","He tried to warn us. Not what an enemy would do."
"Narration/&NightAttack_8_Pragmatic_Slang","He tried to save our hides, remember?"
"Narration/&NightAttack_9_Pragmatic_Formal","His warning might have saved us all, mind you."
"Narration/&NightAttack_10_Selfpres_Normal","He just wants us to think he's a friend."
"Narration/&NightAttack_11_Selfpres_Formal","It might be an elaborate scheme to gain our trust."
"Narration/&NightAttack_12_Pragmatic_Default","Too far-fetched."
"Narration/&NightAttack_13_Friendly_Default","So what do we do?"
"Narration/&NightAttack_14_Friendly_Slang","What's the plan, then?"
"Narration/&NightAttack_15_Friendly_Formal","Be that as it may, what shall we do now?"
"Narration/&NightAttack_16_Pragmatic_Normal","Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided."
"Narration/&NightAttack_17_Pragmatic_Formal","We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say."
"Narration/&NightAttack_18_Nosy_Default","Or we could pay Surespell a visit."
"Narration/&NightAttack2_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Ah, here you are."
"Narration/&NightAttack2_2_Any_Normal","Are you surprised?"
"Narration/&NightAttack2_3_Any_Formal","Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?"
"Narration/&NightAttack2_4_Any_Slang","That's right. Surprised?"
"Narration/&NightAttack2_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Not really. I did warn you, after all. I'm glad you were careful."
"Narration/&NightAttack2_6_Any_Default","How did you know?"
"Narration/&NightAttack2_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Call it a hunch. "
"Narration/&NightAttack2_8_Any_Slang","A great, steaming pile of hunch. Got a bridge to sell, too?"
"Narration/&NightAttack2_9_Any_Normal","Oh, really?"
"Narration/&NightAttack2_10_Any_Formal","You can't expect us to believe that?"
"Narration/&NightAttack2_11_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Oh, I have friends who… gather information."
"Narration/&NightAttack2_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","The threat felt credible. I thought it wise to share."
"Narration/&NightAttack2_13_Cynical_Normal","It felt real enough to us, too."
"Narration/&NightAttack2_14_Cynical_Formal","Real enough to leave a scar, that much is certain."
"Narration/&NightAttack2_15_Selfpres_Default","You know more than you're telling."
"Narration/&NightAttack2_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Always. But I'm on your side, and that's all that matters."
"Narration/&NightAttack2_17_Cynical_Normal","Really? Aren't we lucky? So what other pearls of wisdom do you have to share - friend?"
"Narration/&NightAttack2_18_Cynical_Formal","In that case, you'd be happy to advise us further, I presume?"
"Narration/&NightAttack2_19_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Certainly. Always drink wine at the Gravekeep's Cask. Their beer is utterly foul."
"Narration/&NightAttack2_20_Pragmatic_Normal","Seriously? Everyone knows that!"
"Narration/&NightAttack2_21_Pragmatic_Formal","That's disappointing. You can do better than common knowledge, I'm sure. "
"Narration/&NightAttack2_21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","But clearly you're here for business, not small talk."
"Narration/&NightAttack4_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Ah, here you are."
"Narration/&NightAttack4_2_Any_Normal","Are you surprised?"
"Narration/&NightAttack4_3_Any_Formal","Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?"
"Narration/&NightAttack4_4_Any_Slang","That's right. Surprised?"
"Narration/&NightAttack4_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Not at all, since you followed my… advice."
"Narration/&NightAttack4_4_Any_Default","How do you know that?"
"Narration/&NightAttack4_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","You're here, alive and unwounded."
"Narration/&NightAttack4_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I heard there was some disturbance at the residence."
"Narration/&NightAttack4_7_Any_Default","Is that so?"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_1_CaptainIronshell_NPC","Senior deputies!"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_2_Friendly_Default","Captain! What's the news?"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_3_CaptainIronshell_NPC","You didn't hear?"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_4_CaptainIronshell_NPC","Your quarters at the residence were ransacked!"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_5_Nosy_Default","What? When?"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_6_CaptainIronshell_NPC","During the night. It's lucky you weren't there."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_7_Cynical_Formal","Eh. We could have handled a burglar or two."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_8_Cynical_Normal","No doubt we would have seen the villains off, had we been there."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_9_CaptainIronshell_NPC","They were more than simple burglars, to infiltrate the palace undetected."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_10_Nosy_Default","Who, then?"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_11_CaptainIronshell_NPC","I can't say for sure but…"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_12_CaptainIronshell_NPC","Some are saying… Sorr-Akkath."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_13_Selfpres_Formal","That's a worrying prospect, Captain."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_14_Selfpres_Slang","So much for palace security, then. Thanks a lot!"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_15_Selfpres_Normal","We were supposed to be safe there, remember?"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_16_CaptainIronshell_NPC","I'm well aware. We have put further magical security measures in place."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_17_Friendly_Default","Good to know."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_18_Friendly_Normal","Thanks for the heads-up, Captain."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_19_Friendly_Formal","Thank you for keeping us informed, Captain."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_20_CaptainIronshell_NPC","You are most welcome."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_21_CaptainIronshell_NPC","Good day to you, senior deputies."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_22_Nosy_Normal","So he told the truth, that Heddlon."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_23_Nosy_Formal","It appears Heddlon Surespell was right."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_24_Pragmatic_Default","He knew, but how?"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_25_Selfpres_Normal","He's a spy, or something similar."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_26_Selfpres_Formal","I'm pretty sure he's Imperial Intelligence."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_27_Selfpres_Slang","The guy is a spook, it's practically written on his face."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_28_Pragmatic_Default","He looks normal to me."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_29_Logical_Default","That's what spies do. "
"Narration/&NightAttack3_30_Friendly_Default","So, what do we do?"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_31_Friendly_Slang","So - now what?"
"Narration/&NightAttack3_32_Friendly_Formal","We must decide on our next move."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_33_Pragmatic_Normal","Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_34_Pragmatic_Formal","We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say."
"Narration/&NightAttack3_35_Nosy_Default","Or we could pay Surespell a visit."
"Narration/&Council5_1_LeiraKean_NPC","Honorable delegates, please be seated!"
"Narration/&Council5_2_LeiraKean_NPC","The Legacy Council is now in session!"
"Narration/&Council5_3_LeiraKean_NPC","Chancellor Gormsdottir has the floor."
"Narration/&Council5_4_Gormsdottir_NPC","Thank you, Protector."
"Narration/&Council5_5_Gormsdottir_NPC","Honorable Council members, we at the Guild of Antiquarians have come to an agreement…"
"Narration/&Council5_6_Gormsdottir_NPC","…regarding the quest for the gems of the Crown of the Magister."
"Narration/&Council5_7_Gormsdottir_NPC","We believe that the Crown should be secured, and therefore surrendered by its current owners…"
"Narration/&Council5_8_Gormsdottir_NPC","…in exchange for a generous payment…"
"Narration/&Council5_9_Gormsdottir_NPC","…raised by all parties in the Council."
"Narration/&Council5_10_Crownbearer_Default","You can't!"
"Narration/&Council5_11_LeiraKean_NPC","You will wait for your turn to speak, senior deputy!"
"Narration/&Council5_12_Crownbearer_Default","We searched the Badlands for these gems, and now you're just taking the Crown away from us?"
"Narration/&Council5_13_LeiraKean_NPC","Order!"
"Narration/&Council5_14_Danantar_NPC","We are all well aware of your reservations, and we understand them."
"Narration/&Council5_15_Danantar_NPC","Yet, from what I heard, all parties have agreed that you should comply…"
"Narration/&Council5_16_Danantar_NPC","…for the security of all."
"Narration/&Council5_17_Crownbearer_Default","Security? You talk of security?"
"Narration/&Council5_18_Crownbearer_Default","What security? Just last night, Soraks attacked our quarters in the residence!"
"Narration/&Council5_19_Faisech_NPC","What?"
"Narration/&Council5_20_Sunblaze_NPC","Soraks? Here in Caer Cyflen?"
"Narration/&Council5_21_Danantar_NPC","In the palace?"
"Narration/&Council5_22_LeiraKean_NPC","Order!"
"Narration/&Council5_23_Sunblaze_NPC","Immediate action is needed!"
"Narration/&Council5_24_Danantar_NPC","Well, find the damned Soraks, then!"
"Narration/&Council5_25_LeiraKean_NPC","Please, my lords!"
"Narration/&Council5_26_Danantar_NPC","Where are your paladins?"
"Narration/&Council5_27_Sunblaze_NPC","Where are your wizards and their divination spells?"
"Narration/&Council5_28_LeiraKean_NPC","Stop it!"
"Narration/&Council5_29_LeiraKean_NPC","None of this is helping!"
"Narration/&Council5_30_LeiraKean_NPC","Lord Sunblaze, you're supposed to be neutral here!"
"Narration/&Council5_31_LeiraKean_NPC","Someone must introduce a formal request."
"Narration/&Council5_32_Danantar_NPC","Right. Apologies."
"Narration/&Council5_33_Danantar_NPC","You're right, let's vote. Only senior members, please."
"Narration/&Council5_34_Danantar_NPC","Those for securing the Crown, say aye."
"Narration/&Council5_35_Gormsdottir_Default","Aye."
"Narration/&Council5_36_Faisech_NPC","Aye."
"Narration/&Council5_37_Danantar_NPC","Aye."
"Narration/&Council5_38_Keenmind_Default","…nay."
"Narration/&Council5_39_Sunblaze_NPC","Nay."
"Narration/&Council5_40_Danantar_NPC","Well, we have a majority."
"Narration/&Council5_41_Sunblaze_NPC","We'll help you with the… attunement issue."
"Narration/&Council5_42_Faisech_NPC","Wait! Who's going to take the Crown, and where?"
"Narration/&Council5_43_Danantar_NPC","Well, the most secure location would be…"
"Narration/&Council5_44_Danantar_NPC","…the temple of Einar, of course. The Hearth."
"Narration/&Council5_45_Faisech_NPC","Of course - right here in Caer Cyflen!"
"Narration/&Council5_46_Faisech_NPC","Neutral ground, of course, but still the Principality of Masgarth is the center of Solasta!"
"Narration/&Council5_47_Danantar_NPC","Do you have a better idea, Dean Faisech?"
"Narration/&Council5_48_Faisech_NPC","We have secure locations, too!"
"Narration/&Council5_49_Danantar_NPC","How many high-ranking paladins in your Tower, Faisech?"
"Narration/&Council5_50_Faisech_NPC","More than actual wizards in your school!"
"Narration/&Council5_51_LeiraKean_NPC","Order!"
"Narration/&Council5_52_LeiraKean_NPC","Remember the dignity of your positions, my lords!"
"Narration/&Council5_53_LeiraKean_NPC","Senior deputies - if you please? The Council has spoken."
"Narration/&Council5_54_Choice_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","This is a mistake."
"Narration/&Council5_55_Choice_Mean_WRITTEN","You're all stupid!"
"Narration/&Council5_56_Choice_Lawful_WRITTEN","We must obey the Council…"
"Narration/&Council5_57_Choice_Selfpres_WRITTEN","Someone here is a traitor!"
"Narration/&Council5_58_Choice_Pragmatic_Default","This is a mistake. We are bound to the Crown."
"Narration/&Council5_59_LeiraKean_NPC","You are sworn deputies. You must comply."
"Narration/&Council5_60_Choice_Mean_Default","The Council doesn't deserve the Crown - you just proved that!"
"Narration/&Council5_61_LeiraKean_NPC","Surrender the Crown, as the Council orders."
"Narration/&Council5_62_Choice_Lawful_Default","We serve the Council."
"Narration/&Council5_63_LeiraKean_NPC","And you shall be commended, senior deputies."
"Narration/&Council5_64_Choice_Selfpres_Default","You keep bickering instead of looking for the traitor among you!"
"Narration/&Council5_65_LeiraKean_NPC","This is a grave accusation, senior deputy."
"Narration/&Council5_66_Authority_Default","How could they?"
"Narration/&Council5_67_Pragmatic_Default","It can't end like this!"
"Narration/&Council5_68_Crownbearer_Default","I can hear it calling!"
"Narration/&Council5_69_HalmanSummer_NPC","Senior deputies, please, a word?"
"Narration/&Council5_70_Authority_Default","Summer? What do you want? "
"Narration/&Council5_71_Authority_Default","Your chancellor led the charge against us in there."
"Narration/&Council5_72_HalmanSummer_NPC","I'm truly sorry. But, I have some information that might interest you."
"Narration/&Council5_73_Selfpres_Default","I doubt it."
"Narration/&Council5_74_HalmanSummer_NPC","It's about the secret cult of Arivad."
"Narration/&Council5_75_Nosy_Default","What?"
"Narration/&Council5_76_HalmanSummer_NPC","I admit, this is second-hand intelligence, but still…"
"Narration/&Council5_77_Authority_Default","Speak up."
"Narration/&Council5_78_HalmanSummer_NPC","One of my people saw a man with a tattoo…"
"Narration/&Council5_79_Selfpres_Default","The letter A?"
"Narration/&Council5_80_HalmanSummer_NPC","Yes. He followed the man all day, and to a gathering that night…"
"Narration/&Council5_81_HalmanSummer_NPC","…in a remote village to the south."
"Narration/&Council5_82_Authority_Default","What village?"
"Narration/&Council5_83_HalmanSummer_NPC","It's called Earcorn. Very small…"
"Narration/&Council5_84_HalmanSummer_NPC","…but you'll find it easily on any local map."
"Narration/&Council5_85_Friendly_Default","Thank you, Halman."
"Narration/&Council5_86_HalmanSummer_NPC","You're welcome. Someone must take care of these cultists."
"Narration/&Council5_87_HalmanSummer_NPC","And the Council… well, you know."
"Narration/&Council5_88_Pragmatic_Default","Yes, we do."
"Narration/&Council5_After_1_BericSunblaze_NPC","I'm so sorry."
"Narration/&Council5_After_2_Friendly_Default","Why? You didn't betray us."
"Narration/&Council5_After_3_BericSunblaze_NPC","I understand how they see things, but…"
"Narration/&Council5_After_4_Selfpres_Normal","Something's wrong with the Council."
"Narration/&Council5_After_5_Selfpres_Slang","The Council's rotten."
"Narration/&Council5_After_6_BericSunblaze_NPC","The Council's still young. Everyone is angling for influence…"
"Narration/&Council5_After_7_BericSunblaze_NPC","…but squabbling academics are better than clashing armies."
"Narration/&Council5_After_8_Nosy_Default","Only Airgetine supported us? I mean, beside you."
"Narration/&Council5_After_9_Selfpres_Default","Why would the New Empire be the only friend we have in there?"
"Narration/&Council5_After_10_BericSunblaze_NPC","Airgetine's a moderate, it's true, but the New Empire is subtle. Plans within plans."
"Narration/&Council5_After_11_BericSunblaze_NPC","It's hard to say whether he was following orders or voting his conscience."
"Narration/&Council5_After_12_BericSunblaze_NPC","I wouldn't read too much into his vote, at least for now. "
"Narration/&Council5_After_13_BericSunblaze_NPC","It didn't change anything, anyway."
"Narration/&Council5_After_14_BericSunblaze_NPC","But what about you? How are you coping without the Crown?"
"Narration/&Council5_After_15_Crownbearer_Default","Better than I expected."
"Narration/&Council5_After_16_Any2_Default","Same for me, actually. It almost feels like we still have the Crown."
"Narration/&Council5_After_17_Any3_Default","Exactly. We lost its magical power, but…"
"Narration/&Council5_After_18_Any2_Default","…the voice is still calling."
"Narration/&Council5_After_19_BericSunblaze_NPC","Interesting. So the attunement is unaffected by physical separation?"
"Narration/&Council5_After_20_Friendly_Any","Keep the Crown safe, Marshal, will you, please?"
"Narration/&Council5_After_21_BericSunblaze_NPC","You have my word."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_1_Merton_NPC","Hey, you!"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_2_Cynical_Default","Not drowning in your beer today, Arwin?"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_3_Merton_NPC","No, wait!"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_4_Merton_NPC","They took the Crown from you?"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_5_Selfpres_Default","How do you know that?"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_6_Merton_NPC","How? You really think I'm just a drunk?"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_7_Merton_NPC","The whole Principality knows you have that Crown."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_8_Merton_NPC","I mean had."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_9_Cynical_Normal","Yeah."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_10_Cynical_Formal","Indeed."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_11_Merton_NPC","Something's not right."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_12_Cynical_Normal","You think we need you to tell us?"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_13_Merton_NPC","I mean something's up - something big."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_14_Pragmatic_Normal","What, exactly?"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_15_Merton_NPC","They're here."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_16_Selfpres_Default","Who? The Soraks?"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_17_Merton_NPC","Not them. Their pawns."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_18_Lawful_Default","You're drunk."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_19_Merton_NPC","What's wrong with you? "
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_20_Merton_NPC","Haven't you seen enough?"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_21_Merton_NPC","Didn't you see what they can do? "
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_22_Merton_NPC","To people?"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_23_Merton_NPC","At first I thought you were just another bunch of brainless Council lackeys…"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_24_Merton_NPC","…but you've seen their ways."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_25_Merton_NPC","At Coparann, and plenty other places, I'm sure."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_26_Merton_NPC","The way they get into people's heads."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_27_Merton_NPC","I've watched the people of Caer Cyflen for ten years."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_28_Merton_NPC","I've felt a change - slow, subtle…"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_29_Merton_NPC","…until now. It's getting stronger!"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_30_Merton_NPC","I can't let them win."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_31_Cynical_Default","So what? You're ready to become a hero again?"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_32_Merton_NPC","I can still fight."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_33_Pragmatic_Default","Are you offering to join us?"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_34_Merton_NPC","You brought back my sword."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_35_Merton_NPC","That blade and I, we've slain countless abominations down there in the Badlands."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_36_Merton_NPC","You helped me get closure for my lost child."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_37_Merton_NPC","You were at my side when we took down the remorhaz."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_38_Merton_NPC","Yes, I'd like to join you."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_39_Choice_WRITTEN","Fine."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_40_Choice_WRITTEN","No."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_41_Agreed_Default","Fine, come with us."
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_42_Refused_Default","You're useless!"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_43_Refused_Merton","And you're stupid!"
"Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_44_Agreed_Merton","Ha ha! Now you're talking!"
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_1_Authority_Default","This is it? Earcorn!"
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_2_Merton_NPC","Look, a farm! And another! High adventure - I love it!"
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_3_Cynical_Normal","This doesn't exactly feel like the headquarters for a massive invasion."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_4_Cynical_Slang","Some headquarters. Dark cults used to be better."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_5_Cynical_Formal","Not exactly how I imagined the lair of evil Sorr-Akkath worshippers."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_6_Pragmatic_Default","But it could be hiding a small group of infiltrators."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_7_Pragmatic_Default","Still, a good cover for cunning infiltrators."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_8_Pragmatic_Normal","Let's look around for anything suspicious."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_9_Pragmatic_Formal","Let us examine the area in search of clues."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_10_Cynical_Default","No tavern? That's suspicious for a start."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_11_Merton_NPC","That was my line!"
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_12_Authority_Slang","Shut up! We're trying to be stealthy!"
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_13_Authority_Normal","You'd better be quiet if you don't want us to be spotted."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_1_14_Authority_Format","Quiet, if you please. Let discretion be our watchword."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_2_1_Any_Default","I have something!"
"Narration/&FightingCultists_2_2_Cynical_Default","Footprints? Really? It's a village. People live here."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_2_3_Cynical_Default","Random footprints in a village? Not much of a clue."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_2_4_Merton_NPC","Your villagers have claws."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_2_5_Any_Default","Your villagers have claws."
"Narration/&FightingCultists_2_6_Selfpres_Default","Soraks?"
"Narration/&FightingCultists_2_7_Authority_Default","This is it! Be ready for anything."
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_1_Pragmatic_Default","That didn't feel like we surprised them."
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_2_Violent_Default","Because we didn't."
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_3_Selfpres_Default","This was a trap."
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_4_Merton_NPC","Yep, carefully set up to kill us - well, you, I guess."
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_5_Selfpres_Default","Halman Summer?"
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_6_Pragmatic_Default","He said the intelligence wasn't certain."
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_7_Merton_NPC","The Antiquarian? He told you about this place?"
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_8_Violent_Default","He's a traitor!"
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_9_Nosy_Default","A Sorak in disguise?"
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_10_Pragmatic_Default","Or just one of their agents."
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_11_Merton_NPC","Or just one of their agents."
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_12_Pragmatic_Default","Anyone checked him for a tattoo?"
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_13_Violent_Default","There's only one way to know for sure."
"Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_14_Authority_Default","Let's go back to Caer Cyflen."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Normal","What's going on?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Formal","What is all this?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_2_Pragmatic_Default","Is that the army? In the city?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_3_Violent_Default","Let's find Summer!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_4_Pragmatic_Default","I'd prefer to find Carran first."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_5_Merton_NPC","I have to check on someone. I'll catch you later."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_6_Nosy_Default","Check on who?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_7_Nosy_Default","I thought he had no friends left."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_8_Cynical_Default","His brewer, maybe?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Normal","Hello, Karel! Have you seen Lord Carran?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Slang","Hey, Karel! Seen Carran around?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Formal","Greetings, master Martel. Have you seen lord Carran recently?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_2_KarelMartel_NPC","Not since the conscription."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_3_Any_Default","Conscription? Is that what's happening?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_4_KarelMartel_NPC","I know, it's been in the air, but now…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_5_KarelMartel_NPC","…rumors has it that Gallivan's armies are massing at the eastern border."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_6_Any_Default","Gallivan? Why?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_7_KarelMartel_NPC","Ask your friends on the Council. They were supposed to keep the peace."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar1_Any_Default","Robar? You've been drafted?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar2_Robar_NPC","Don't be ridiculous - I enlisted! Gets me the rank I deserve. Finally."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar3_Any_Default","Captain? That's even higher than Beryl Stonebeard."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar4_Robar_NPC","I'd rather forget that time, fighting Soraks in that hellhole Caer Lem."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar5_Any_NPC","Is war really better?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar6_Sellsword_Default","Can't disagree."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar7_Robar_NPC","Gallivan's armies are honest foes - flesh, blood, and steel."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar8_Any_NPC","If you say so."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar9_Any_NPC","Be safe, Robar."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar10_Sellsword_Default","To the bitter end, brother."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar11_Robar_Default","To the bitter end."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar12_Robar_Default","You, too."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Any_NPC","Beryl? What's going on?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Highclass_Default","Lady Stonebeard, what is happening?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl2_Beryl_NPC","You still here? I suppose we owe this mess to you?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl3_Any_Default","What mess?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl4_Beryl_NPC","War. Or the threat of war."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl5_Any_Default","We didn't do anything!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl6_Beryl_NPC","Well, the Snow Alliance representatives are leaving."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl7_Beryl_NPC","We don't want to be caught between Masgarth and Gallivan."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl8_Any_Default","How about maintaining peace?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl9_Beryl_NPC","I did my part. Didn't work."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl10_Any_Default","When are you leaving?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl11_Beryl_NPC","As soon as my dawdling cousin gives the order."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl12_Beryl_NPC","Let's hope we can meet again, on the same side."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl13_Any_NPC","Farewell, Beryl."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl14_Highclass_Default","Good luck, my lady."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl15_Beryl_NPC","Cut the 'my' lady stuff, will you?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat1_Any_Default","Daliat! What's going on?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat2_Daliat_NPC","Well, I'd rather not say."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat3_Any_Default","Always secretive."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat4_Spy_Default","Do we still need to play this game?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Oh, hello."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat6_Any_Default","Heddlon Surespell, what a surprise."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat7_Spy_Default","Are you two related?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat8_Daliat_NPC","He's my superior."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Two ranks above."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat10_Daliat_Default","Right."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat11_Spy_NPC","So, you two are spies?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat12_HeddlonSurespell_Default","Such a crude word."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat13_Daliat_NPC","We prefer the old name: 'Silent Whisper.'"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat14_Lawful_Default","The intelligence service of the Manacalon Empire? Really?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat15_Daliat_NPC","Nicer than 'spies.'"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat16_Authority_Default","So, what's in there?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat17_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Nothing and no one, I'm afraid."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat18_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I was looking for your… acquaintance, Halman Summer."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat19_Violent_Default","Oh, him?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat20_Violent_Default","We were looking for him, too."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I'm afraid he's gone."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat22_Pragmatic_Default","Isn't everybody leaving?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat23_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","The Antiquarians and the other Snow Alliance people are pulling out."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat24_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","The Antiquarians are still packing up, though."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat25_Pragmatic_Default","He sent after a lead…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat26_Selfpres_Default","…or rather, into a trap."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat27_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I'm not surprised."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat28_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","We had eyes on him, but… we lost him."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat29_Selfpres_Default","Is he that good?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat30_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Or he had help. Magical."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat31_Selfpres_NPC","Soraks?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat32_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Who knows?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat33_Pragmatic_NPC","What triggered all this?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat34_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","You should really get to the Council."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat35_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","They'll tell you everything."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_1_Carran_NPC","In Maraike's name! You're here!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_Any_Default","What is happening?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_3_Carran_NPC","The whole delegation from the Tower of Knowledge - they were poisoned!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_4_Nosy_Default","Poisoned? How many died?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_5_Carran_NPC","All of them, thirty-something, but that's not the point."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_6_Carran_NPC","After Dean Faisech accused the Council of… favoritism toward the Principality…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_7_Carran_NPC","…for keeping the Crown in Caer Cyflen."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_8_Pragmatic_Default","At the Temple of Einar, which is not affiliated with the Principality."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_9_Carran_NPC","I know that, of course."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_10_Carran_NPC","Yet, soon after, we all ate at the same table, but the Tower delegates died in their sleep."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_11_Carran_NPC","Of course, Gallivan took it as an attack by the Principality."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_12_Pragmatic_Default","But that's why the Tower's on the Council, and not Gallivan's government - to avoid exactly that!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_13_Carran_NPC","You think I don't know that?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_14_Carran_NPC","This is real politics, my friends - diplomacy is dead."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_15_Cynical_Default","So the Legacy Council was a sham all along?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_16_Carran_NPC","No! It was a real, honest effort to maintain peace."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_17_Cynical_Default","And it failed."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_18_Carran_NPC","We're not at war yet."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_19_Pragmatic_Default","But Gallivan's massing troops at the border."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_20_Carran_NPC","Bad news really does travel fast."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_21_Carran_NPC","Anyway, pressure is growing for the Princess to… intervene."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_22_Cynical_Default","Her? How?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_23_Carran_NPC","Not as a member of the Council. As head of state."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_24_Carran_NPC","But tell me, where were you now that your quest is… well…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_25_Authority_Default","Chasing the Soraks and their pawns."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_26_Cynical_Default","Unsuccessfully."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_27_Violent_Default","Halman Summer might have been one of them."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_28_Carran_NPC","What? The man was… I mean, I dined at his mansion recently… he…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_29_Nosy_Default","Where?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_30_Carran_NPC","Where what?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_31_Authority_Default","A mansion? He told us he lived at the Snow Alliance embassy."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_32_Carran_NPC","No - his family has a mansion in town."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_33_Carran_NPC","Oddly, it's right next door to the Circle of Danantar's headquarters."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_34_Authority_Default","We need to go there."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_35_Carran_NPC","I might need you when you're done with this errand."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad1_Authority_Normal","Is that it?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad2_Authority_Formal","Is this the place?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad3_Nosy_Normal","I don't see a sign, or a coat of arms, or anything."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad4_Nosy_Formal","Nothing to say this is Halman Summer's residence."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad5_Spy_Normal","Not bad for a secret home."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad6_Spy_Slang","He's no dummy."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad7_Pragmatic_Formal","And close to official buildings - who would suspect anything?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad8_Pragmatic_Normal","Hiding in plain sight - classic."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad9_Spy_Default","Let's go around. Maybe find a window and get inside."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad10_Lawful_Default","We should obtain a warrant."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad11_Pragmatic_Default","We're past that, don't you think?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad12_Violent_Default","Since I intend to kill him, I believe we are."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad13_Spy_Default","Come on - they're all preparing for war, no one's paying attention."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside1_Any_Normal","This place is… insane."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside2_Any_Formal","Truly, a den of madness."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside3_Religion_Maraike_Default","Holy Maraike…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside4_Religion_Einar_Default","Einar protect us all…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside5_Religion_Arun_Default","In the name of Arun, this place is unthinkable!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside6_Religion_Pakri_Default","Pakri be with us, we have found our enemy!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside7_Lawful_Default","In the middle of Caer Cyflen! How could they…?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside8_Pragmatic_Default","Dissimulation is their creed."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside9_Violent_Default","This ends now. Let's kill them all!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside10_Pragmatic_Default","Maybe they have the gems."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded1_Friendly_Normal","Hey - I've seen this man at the Gravekeep's Cask!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded_Friendly_Formal","I know that face! He was at the Gravekeep's Cask."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded2_Pragmatic_Normal","They're all from town!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded3_EinarAuthority_Normal","Corrupted by the Soraks!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded4_Selfpres_Normal","For years, maybe. They were preparing."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded5_Greed_Normal","There's a ton of paperwork here."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded6_Pragmatic_Normal","A lot's been burned, though."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded7_Greed_Normal","No sign of the gems."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded8_Pragmatic_Normal","Look at this - a map of the Badlands."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded9_Nosy_Normal","What are these places?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded10_Pragmatic_Normal","Everywhere we've been… and some other places."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded11_Greed_Normal","The gems… all eight of them."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded12_Nosy_Normal","And this?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded13_History_Normal","Probably the location of the Rift."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded14_History_Normal","It's in the Aer Elai, the heart of Manacalon. Where the capital was."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded15_Nosy_Normal","And this?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded16_Pragmatic_Normal","No idea."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded17_Carver_Normal","Not a dwarf rune."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded18_Greed_Normal","I have a list of names."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded19_Greed_Normal","Some are marked 'converted,' some 'resilient,' and some 'prospects.'"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded20_Pragmatic_Normal","There's a whole book of names here!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded21_Lawful_Normal","We must take this to the authorities!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded22_Helpful_Normal","There will be civil war if we do. People will kill their neighbors!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded23_Violent_Normal","War is coming whatever we do."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_1_Player_Normal","Carran!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_2_Player_Formal","Lord Carran!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_3_Carran_NPC","This isn't a good time."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_4_Player_Normal","We're aware - the city's full of Sorak pawns!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_5_Player_Formal","Indeed, and we have proof of an imminent Sorak attack!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_6_Carran_NPC","Surely you exaggerate!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_7_Player_Normal","Here! A list of all those under or soon to be under Sorak influence."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_8_Carran_NPC","What? Where did you find this?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_9_Player_Normal","Halman Summer's mansion. He was one of them!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_10_Carran_NPC","I can't believe it… all this time…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_11_Player_Normal","There's more!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_12_Player_Normal","Everything suggests that the Soraks have the missing gems."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_13_Player_Normal","They had a map showing everywhere we found gems, plus two other places."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_14_Carran_NPC","Maraike's mercy!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_15_Carran_NPC","We must convene the Council, but… this really isn't the best time."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_16_Player_Normal","The Gallivan situation, I suppose?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_17_Player_Slang","Gallivan, eh? How is it going?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_18_Carran_NPC","All the city's clerics are working to resurrect the victims. I hope it's enough."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_19_Greed_Default","More than thirty? That's a lot of diamonds. And clerics."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_20_Carran_NPC","We didn't really have a choice. The Crown is going to pay."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_21_Greed_Default","What?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_22_Carran_NPC","The envoy from Gallivan was… adamant."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_23_Carran_NPC","The Princess took command of the situation…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_24_Carran_NPC","…and told him Masgarth would pay to resurrect their people."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_25_Pragmatic_Default","So why the troops at the border?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_26_Carran_NPC","Let's call it… an incentive."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_27_Pragmatic_Default","Everything should be fine, then."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_28_Pragmatic_Default","The Principality resurrects the poison victims, Gallivan withdraws its troops."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_29_Carran_NPC","Let's hope so. We don't have any idea who's behind this."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_30_Carran_NPC","Though your little book of secrets here might help us with that."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_31_Violent_Default","So, the Principality is still drafting soldiers."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_32_Carran_NPC","To defend the city. "
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_33_Carran_NPC","The army left for the border as soon as we heard about the threat."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_34_Cynical_Default","So much for confidence."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_35_Carran_NPC","Smiles work better if you have a sword at your side."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_36_Greed_Default","So you're resurrecting Faisech?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_37_Greed_Default","How much is that? A thousand gold pieces?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_38_Carran_NPC","I know what you're going to say. So don't."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_39_Cynical_Default","And someone must pray for his soul… Imagine that!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_40_Carran_NPC","Marshal Sunblaze is taking care of the senior delegates personally."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_41_Selfpres_Default","Wait a minute!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_42_Selfpres_Default","Where is this happening?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_43_Carran_NPC","In the Temple of Einar. You've been in their dispensary…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_44_Carran_NPC","Wait, you don't… they died!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_45_Selfpres_Default","You think they'd stop at that?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_46_Pragmatic_NPC","Thirty-something people inside the most secure place in the Principality…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_47_Pragmatic_NPC","More than thirty possible traitors in the most protected temple in the Principality…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_48_Violent_NPC","…close to the Crown of the Magister?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_49_Carran_NPC","No! No, no, no!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_50_Authority_NPC","What are we waiting for?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_1_Authority_Default","Marshal!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_2_BericSunblaze_NPC","Greetings, friends!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_3_Authority_Default","Where are the delegates?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_4_BericSunblaze_NPC","In the dispensary."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_5_BericSunblaze_NPC","What's going on?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_6_Friendly_Default","Are you all right?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_7_BericSunblaze_NPC","I just cast a resurrection spell… forgive me - it is rather draining."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_8_BericSunblaze_NPC","Wait!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_9_Cynical_Normal","Feeling good, dead people?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_10_Cynical_Formal","All right, everyone, we know who you are."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_11_SorakAgent_NPC","Attack!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_1_BericSunblaze_NPC","By Einar… Sorak agents, in the temple!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_2_Authority_Default","Where's the Crown?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_3_BericSunblaze_NPC","Take this key. I… can't run."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_4_BericSunblaze_NPC","Follow the light!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_5_Authority_Default","Let's go!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_1_Authority_Default","There!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_2_Selfpres_Default","It's gone!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_3_Pragmatic_Default","Here! A secret passage?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_4_Selfpres_Default","In the middle of the temple?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_5_Authority_Default","How did they miss that?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_6_Pragmatic_Default","Doesn't matter now!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Pragmatic_Default","This is ancient - from the first centuries after the Cataclysm!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_8_Pragmatic_Default","No time for a history lesson!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Any_Default","They went this way!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_1_Any_Default","The city's Imperial Gate!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_2_Any_Default","They're here!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_3_Any_Default","They're trying to get away with the Crown!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_4_Any_Default","Protector!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_5_LeiraKean_NPC","We failed! They got away with it!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_6_Any_Default","No!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_7_Merton_NPC","They must not destroy the gate!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_8_Any_Default","It's not over! They must not destroy the gate!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_9_Merton_NPC","There's too many of them!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple9_Merton_NPC","Come on! Fight!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_1_Any_Default","Look!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_2_Any_Default","The Princess?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_3_Merton_NPC","Ha, ha, ha! Come on, old lady - time to show off!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_4_Princess_NPC","One day, Arwin Merton…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter1_Princess_NPC","Don't look at me like that."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter2_Any_Default","Your Royal Highness…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter3_Princess_NPC","…thank you is what you're looking for."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter4_Any_Default","Thank you."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter5_Pragmatic_Default","They took the Crown."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter6_Princess_NPC","Is this… evil god coming?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter7_Authority_Default","I suppose that's their plan."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter8_Pragmatic_Default","Can we follow them? "
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter9_Selfpres_Default","There's no way to know where they've gone."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter10_Selfpres_Default","There are so many gates."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter11_Pragmatic_Default","Close to the Rift, right? Where it all began?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter12_Authority_Default","No one knows exactly where the Rift was."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter13_Merton_NPC","In the Aer Elai, near the capital of Manacalon - but it's a vast area!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter14_Pragmatic_Default","They must have scouted it and found a teleporter nearby."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter15_Selfpres_Default","So we're doomed?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter16_Authority_Default","What's going on?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter17_Merton_NPC","We're under attack!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter18_Merton_NPC","Sleeper agents! Everywhere in the city!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter19_Princess_Default","Are they so powerful, the Sorr-Akkath?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter20_History_Default","Your Royal Highness…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter21_History_Default","We found this in Halman Summer's chambers, magically concealed."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter22_History_Default","Do you have any ideas?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter23_Princess_NPC","This is Sunset Peak, south of Aer Elai. "
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter24_Princess_NPC","I recognize this tower… or what's left of it."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter25_Princess_NPC","There is a gate not too far away."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter26_Princess_NPC","But who knows how the place looks like now?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter27_Authority_Default","We're running out of time! If there is a chance to stop them…"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter28_Violent_Default","They don't stand a chance against you!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter29_Princess_NPC","Alas, I cannot go into the Badlands."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter30_Nosy_Default","What? Why?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter31_Princess_NPC","Long story short: it would kill me faster than any dark god."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter32_Princess_NPC","There's no time to explain - you have to trust me."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter33_Princess_NPC","Only you can save Solasta now."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter34_Selfpres_Default","Us? What about all your… heroes, and all?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter35_Princess_NPC","Marshal Sunblaze is weakened from casting Resurrection spells, and so are most of his clerics."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter36_Pragmatic_Default","Oh… they planned this as well, didn't they?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter37_Princess_NPC","All my best fighters and spellblades are on the border."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter38_Princess_NPC","Protector Kean is not what she used to be."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter39_Authority_Default","Merton? You coming?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter40_Princess_NPC","He's staying with me. Caer Cyflen is on fire, its streets full of Sorak pawns on a murder spree."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter41_Princess_NPC","The Crown needs you. I felt it, from the beginning."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter42_Princess_NPC","Kaseinax's spirit calls for you to save him from the darkness."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter43_Nosy_Default","The Magister? You knew him?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter44_Princess_NPC","You're too curious for your own good."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter45_Authority_Default","So, Merton's staying."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter46_Merton_NPC","Can't say no to a princess. Especially that one."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter47_Authority_Default","Fine, then."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter48_Princess_NPC","I can only give you a few trinkets to help you in your endeavor."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter49_Princess_NPC","And my blessing."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter50_Sellsword_Default","My arm is yours, Princess."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter51_Aristocrat_Default","Serving you is the greatest honor, your royal highness."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter52_Spy_Default","You're definitely the best crowned head around."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter53_Academic_Default","To think that you knew the Magister? I have so many questions!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter54_Lowlife_Default","That's more than enough, Princess. We'll do your dirty work."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter55_Lawkeeper_Default","We will prevail or die, your royal highness."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter56_Philosopher_Default","So powerful - and yet so helpless to save Solasta. Fascinating."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter57_AcolyteEinar_Default","Einar will be with us, your royal highness."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter58_AcolyteMaraike_Default","Maraike will be with us in life and death."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter59_AcolyteArun_Default","May Arun guide us all."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter60_AcolytePakri_Default","Justice will be served, your royal highness."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter61_Princess_NPC","You should rest and prepare yourselves."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter62_Authority_Default","Sleep, now? There's no time!"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter63_Princess_NPC","You really should start admitting that you don't know everything."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter64_Princess_NPC","Rest now. Time will wait for you, I promise."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter65_Princess_NPC","I will speak the words that will activate the gate for Sunset Peak."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter66_Princess_NPC","When you are ready, step onto the gate, and fulfill your destiny."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse1_Nosy_Default","Did she just… stop time?"
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse2_Acolyte_Default","This is unnatural."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse3_Selfpres_Default","I won't be able to sleep now."
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse4_Authority_Default","You know what's at stake. "
"Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse5_Authority_Default","We'll need to be ready for anything."
"Narration/&Mertonswife1_Bitterroot_NPC","Damned Soraks right under our noses, eh?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_Bitterroot_NPC","It's worse than I thought. I met with this fake baron more than once recently..."
"Narration/&Mertonswife3_Bitterroot_NPC","Didn't see a difference."
"Narration/&Mertonswife4_Lawful_Normal","Nice to meet you, too."
"Narration/&Mertonswife5_Lawful_Formal","And who might you be, lady?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife6_Bitterroot_NPC","Call me Bitterroot."
"Narration/&Mertonswife7_Nosy_Formal","That's a peculiar name."
"Narration/&Mertonswife8_Nosy_Normal","So that's not your real name?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife9_Bitterroot_NPC","It's the only name I need."
"Narration/&Mertonswife10_Bitterroot_NPC","Tell me something."
"Narration/&Mertonswife11_Bitterroot_NPC","You're bound to the Legacy Council, right?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife12_Cynical_Normal","I knew these badges would help eventually."
"Narration/&Mertonswife13_Friendly_Normal","Yes, we are. Interested in joining?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife14_Bitterroot_NPC","Ever heard of Arwin Merton? He's probably marinating in some tavern in Caer Cyflen."
"Narration/&Mertonswife15_Authority_Normal","We met him."
"Narration/&Mertonswife16_Bitterroot_NPC","If you'd be so kind, I have something I'd like you to take back to him."
"Narration/&Mertonswife17_Bitterroot_NPC","A message, and a gift."
"Narration/&Mertonswife18_Violent_Normal","Why not go yourself?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife19_Bitterroot_NPC","I'm not going to him. He needs to come to me."
"Narration/&Mertonswife20_Helpful_Normal","A personal matter?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife21_Helpful_Slang","He cheated on you or something?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife22_Helpful_Formal","Sounds like a sensitive topic."
"Narration/&Mertonswife23_Bitterroot_NPC","I'd rather not go into detail. "
"Narration/&Mertonswife24_Authority_Slang","What's the gift?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife25_Authority_Normal","What do we need to take back?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife26_Bitterroot_NPC","A longsword."
"Narration/&Mertonswife27_Pragmatic_Normal","Not too heavy. We could do that."
"Narration/&Mertonswife28_Greed_Normal","But what's the reward?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife29_Bitterroot_NPC","Ah - real heroes!"
"Narration/&Mertonswife30_Bitterroot_NPC","I can give you the location of a... treasure."
"Narration/&Mertonswife31_Cynical_Normal","Of course, everyone keeps a treasure map in their pocket, just in case..."
"Narration/&Mertonswife32_Bitterroot_NPC","It's a Manacalon building in the Badlands."
"Narration/&Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC","The Arcaneum wanted me to loot it."
"Narration/&Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC2","Apparently, it was a Silent Whisper base before the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&Mertonswife34_Greed_Normal","Heddlon Surespell would pay a fortune for what's inside."
"Narration/&Mertonswife35_Bitterroot_NPC","But it's full of monsters. Too many for me."
"Narration/&Mertonswife36_Friendly_Normal","We could team up."
"Narration/&Mertonswife37_Bitterroot_NPC","I've... lost the taste for adventuring."
"Narration/&Mertonswife38_Bitterroot_NPC","Do we have a deal?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife39_Helpful_NPC","Sure."
"Narration/&Mertonswife40_Selfpres_NPC","Not interested."
"Narration/&Mertonswife41_Agree_NPC","Fine, what's the message?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife42_Choice_Refuse","Sorry. We have more important things to do."
"Narration/&Mertonswife43_Choice_Accept","As you wish."
"Narration/&Mertonswife44_Biterroot_NPC","Tell him he still owes me a child, and I'm waiting. Here, in Coparann."
"Narration/&Mertonswife45_Any_Normal","All right... we'll tell him that."
"Narration/&Mertonswife46_Any_Formal","Fine, we'll take your message to him."
"Narration/&Mertonswife47_Biterroot_NPC","Thank you. Here's the blade. And the map."
"Narration/&Mertonswife48_Friendly_Normal","Farewell, Bitterroot."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_1_Any_Normal","Hello, Arwin."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_2_Merton_NPC","Arwin? We're friends now? "
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_3_Merton_NPC","I'll keep calling you kid, I think."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_4_Any_Normal","Whatever."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_5_Any_Formal","Suit yourself."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_6_Any_Normal","We've been to Coparann - ring a bell?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_7_Any_Formal","I suppose you know the name Coparann."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_8_Merton_NPC","You bet."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_9_Any_Normal","Apparently, you are indebted to someone there."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_10_Any_Normal","An elf ranger. She calls herself Bitterroot."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_11_Merton_NPC","Really?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_12_Any_Normal","Something to do with her mood, maybe."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_13_Any_Normal","She said you owe her… a child."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_14_Merton_NPC","She's crazy."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_15_Any_Normal","We just said we'd bring the message. She's still waiting."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_16_Merton_NPC","Yeah… thanks for the message."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_17_Any_Normal","Want to tell us what this is about?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_18_Any_Formal","Maybe you would like to share a story with us?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_19_Merton_NPC","No. I don't."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_20_Any_Normal","You didn't take her child away from her?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_21_Merton_NPC","You're out of line. I'd step back if I were you."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_22_Any_Normal","All right. It's none of our business."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_23_Any_Normal","She gave us this for you."
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_24_Merton_NPC","What?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_25_Merton_NPC","I don't believe it!"
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_26_Merton_NPC","She went back for it…"
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_27_Any_Normal","Feel more like talking now?"
"Narration/&Mertonswife2_28_Merton_NPC","Get out!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_1_Merton_NPC","Hello again! I hear you're the terror of the Badlands."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_Any_Default","We're getting by."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_Any_Default","Did you hear about a lost god?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_Merton_NPC","Sure - if you're ready to die!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_Any_Default","We're not green anymore, Merton."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_Merton_NPC","Fine, but the Lost God? That is the stuff of legend."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_7_Merton_NPC","I've met a lot of people who wanted to find that temple."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_8_Merton_NPC","At first I tried to help. No one ever came back."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_9_Merton_NPC","So I decided to stop talking about it."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_10_Merton_NPC","I felt… well…"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_11_Any_Default","Responsible for their deaths?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_12_Merton_NPC","Responsible? No - they paid for their folly."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_13_Merton_NPC","I just grew tired of repeating the same warning over and over."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_14_Any_Default","Are we bothering you?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_15_Merton_NPC","You're always bothering me."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_16_Any_Default","Let's go."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_17_Merton_NPC","Oh, don't be so sensitive!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_18_Merton_NPC","All right - the temple is real. I've seen it."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_19_Any_Default","You have?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_20_Merton_NPC","It was about fifteen years ago, but yes. I did."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_21_Any_Default","And you didn't raid it?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_22_Merton_NPC","Well, ten of us found the place…"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_23_Merton_NPC","…when I was the only one left, I came home."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_24_Any_Default","The other nine died?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_25_Merton_NPC","Slaughtered. All of them."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_26_Merton_NPC","Still interested?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_27_Any_Default","You think we're not strong enough?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_28_Merton_NPC","I don't know. You're the mighty Sorak killers, after all…"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_29_Merton_NPC","…maybe with me… you'd have a chance."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_30_Any_Default","You'd come with us?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_31_Merton_NPC","I wouldn't let anyone raid that temple without me."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_32_Merton_NPC","You'd never find it, for a start."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_33_Any_Default","Are you after the treasure?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_34_Merton_NPC","Who says there's any treasure?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_35_Merton_NPC","There's a monster - I know that."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_36_Any_NPC","What is it?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_37_Merton_NPC","That, I don't know."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_38_Merton_NPC","I just want to be there first. I want that on my tombstone."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_39_Any_Default","Fair enough."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_40_Merton_NPC","It's a long trip. If you're crazy enough to go, give me some time to pack my gear."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_41_Merton_NPC","I need the rest of the day. I'll wait for you here."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_42_Any_Default","Sure."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_1_Authority_Normal","We're ready to take on that quest, Arwin."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_2_Merton_NPC","Good for you!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_3_Friendly_Normal","Did you change your mind?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_4_Merton_NPC","No, no. I'm ready!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_5_Merton_NPC","Let's go!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_6_Lawful_Normal","Hey, we're supposed to go together, remember?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_7_Merton_NPC","Yeah, about that. I have to go to Coparann first."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_8_Cynical_Normal","Oh - unfinished business, maybe?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_9_Merton_NPC","You know exactly what business."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_10_Authority_Normal","So how about the quest?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_11_Merton_NPC","Your map has a location called Caer Elis."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_12_History_Normal","It's just an old Manacalon name."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_13_Merton_NPC","Maybe, but there is a ruin - you'll see it. It's Tirmarian."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_14_Merton_NPC","I'll be waiting for you."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_15_Selfpres_Normal","What if we don't come?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_16_Merton_NPC","Then damn the lot of you."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_17_Authority_Normal","What we get there before you do?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_18_Merton_NPC","Ha, ha! As if you could!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_19_Merton_NPC","See you there!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_20_Selfpres_Normal","He's crazy. "
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_21_Pragmatic_Normal","And we're going with him."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_1_Merton_NPC","See? I told you I'd be here."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_2_Nosy_Normal","What have you been doing?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_3_Merton_NPC","Catching up with wildlife."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_4_Merton_NPC","It used to be my thing."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_5_Cynical_Normal","Camping in the Badlands? Really?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_6_Merton_NPC","Yep. Shadow Tamer, they called me."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_7_Pragmatic_Normal","Fine, Shadow Tamer - where's the temple?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_8_Merton_NPC","Behind the mist."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_1_Pragmatic_Normal","We're through the mist!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_2_Merton_NPC","Don't get too cocky. This is where my friends died last time."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_3_Religion_Einar_Normal","Einar will guide us."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_4_Religion_Maraike_Normal","Maraike is with us."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_5_Religion_Pakri_Normal","Pakri will clear our minds."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_6_Religion_Arun_Normal","Arun will guide our hearts."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_7_Sellsword_Normal","No pain, no gain."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_8_Selpres_Normal","Thanks for the encouragement."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_9_Merton_NPC","Just saying…"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_1_Selfpres_Normal","We did it!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_2_Merton_NPC","Yeah, we did!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_3_Merton_NPC","There's still the big one, in there!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_4_Pragmatic_Normal","Sure. It's not over yet."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_5_Any_Normal","This is weird. I don't recognize any of these symbols."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_6_Any_Normal","Was there really a lost god?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_7_History_Normal","I think I know what this was:"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_8_History_Normal","A temple of Arivad!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_9_Einar_Normal","Einar protect us!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_10_Any_Normal","Isn't that one of the names of the Sorak god?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_11_History_Normal","Not before the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_12_History_Normal","Arivad was fierce and just on Tirmar - a god of inquisitors."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_13_History_Normal","Before he was corrupted. "
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_14_History_Normal","His good side became Einar."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_15_History_Normal","His bad side was absorbed by Sorr-Tarr and they became one."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_16_Einar_Normal","The name of Arivad is cursed. This place is… evil."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_17_History_Normal","This is just stone, transported here from Tirmar."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_18_History_Normal","Whatever took place within these walls happened a millennium ago."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_19_Einar_Normal","Such evil never fully disappears."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_20_Lawful_Normal","Well, then - let's clean the place up!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_1_Merton_NPC","Well, I must say…"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_2_Merton_NPC","You're the best team I ever had."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_3_Friendly_Normal","Thanks!"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_4_Friendly_Formal","From a living legend like you, that's a great compliment."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_5_Merton_NPC","Now, it's time to take your reward."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_6_Any_Normal","You're leaving?"
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_7_Merton_NPC","I told you. This is it for me - killing that remorhaz, climbing those stairs."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_8_Merton_NPC","I need to tell someone. I'll see you back at Caer Cyflen."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_9_Selfpres_Normal","Mysterious."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_10_Pragmatic_Normal","Crazy but… a damn good ranger."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_11_Nosy_Normal","He's going back to that Bitterroot woman."
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_12_Lawful_Normal","That's none of our business. "
"Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_13_Greed_Normal","Indeed. That chest on the other hand…"
"Narration/&TheAerElai1_Nosy_Default","Look at that…"
"Narration/&TheAerElai2_Nosy_Default","…the heart of the Badlands, almost the epicenter of the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&TheAerElai3_Selfpres_Default","There's nothing left of the Old Empire."
"Narration/&TheAerElai4_Authority_Default","All right, people - we're not here for the view."
"Narration/&TheAerElai5_Arcana_Default","This wind… it's not natural."
"Narration/&TheAerElai6_Arcana_Default","It's a mana wind. We can't use magic to get across."
"Narration/&TheAerElai7_Cynical_Default","So, falling would be a bad idea, then."
"Narration/&TheAerElai8_Lawful_Default","We've been through worse."
"Narration/&TheAerElai9_Selfpres_Default","Watch out!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai10_Nosy_Default","What kind of creature lives in a place like this?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai11_Nature_Default","You got it: fire spiders."
"Narration/&TheAerElai12_Selfpres_Default","Over there! Soraks!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai13_Einar_Default","They don't need to hide here."
"Narration/&TheAerElai14_Pragmatic_Default","They're not paying attention. What are they doing?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai15_Cynical_Default","Dropping gigantic bones into lava?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai16_Pragmatic_Default","Why?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai17_Nature_Default","They're not just any bones…"
"Narration/&TheAerElai18_Nature_Default","…those are dragon bones!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai19_Pragmatic_Default","How many dragons died here?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai20_Arcana_Default","Remember what the Princess said. The place is deadly to them."
"Narration/&TheAerElai21_Authority_Default","There's no other way - we need to get up there!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai22_Cynical_Default","Without being shot at, preferably?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai23_Cynical_Default","More dragon bones?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai24_Pragmatic_Default","That's really what they were doing - cleaning up the place!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai25_Authority_Default","They were destroying the bones!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai26_Nosy_Default","How do you know?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai27_Arcana_Default","The bones are a threat to them!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai28_Pragmatic_Default","I don't follow."
"Narration/&TheAerElai29_Arcana_Default","These are the remains of the Masters of the Arcaneum."
"Narration/&TheAerElai30_Pragmatic_Default","Dragons? All of them?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai31_Arcana_Default","The Master of Abjuration was no exception. They were all dragons."
"Narration/&TheAerElai32_Arcana_Default","Even the Magister."
"Narration/&TheAerElai33_Arcana_Default","And his bones are among those."
"Narration/&TheAerElai34_Pragmatic_Default","I thought I felt something, but…"
"Narration/&TheAerElai35_Cynical_Default","Definitely."
"Narration/&TheAerElai36_Authority_Default","We need to search the bones."
"Narration/&TheAerElai37_Any_Default","Here!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai38_Any2_Default","A tooth?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai39_Any3_Default","It calls to me…"
"Narration/&TheAerElai40_Magister_NPC","Let me… touch my Crown…"
"Narration/&TheAerElai41_Any_Default","Did you hear that?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai42_Any2_Default","I did."
"Narration/&TheAerElai43_Any3_Default","He wants to touch the Crown."
"Narration/&TheAerElai44_Any4_Default","The tooth? Just one little tooth?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai45_Any3_Default","That's why the Soraks want to destroy the bones."
"Narration/&TheAerElai46_Any2_Default","What will happen if we succeed?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai47_Magister_NPC","Let me… touch my Crown…"
"Narration/&TheAerElai48_Authority_Default","There's only one way to find out."
"Narration/&TheAerElai49_Selfpres_Default","This place never ends!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai50_Any2_Default","This is the way - I can hear the Crown!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai51_Any3_Default","Yes! We must go on!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai52_Selfpres_Default","Are we walking into some gigantic trap?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai53_Pragmatic_Default","The Soraks are doing all they can to stop us!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai54_Authority_Default","Come on - don't falter now!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai55_Any_Default","This is it - the Rift!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai56_Selfpres_Default","Is it open again?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai57_Any_Default","Hard to say. "
"Narration/&TheAerElai58_Any_Default","I see a bunch of Soraks, but not the countless horde they're expecting."
"Narration/&TheAerElai59_Cynical_Default","And no god."
"Narration/&TheAerElai60_Any_Default","The Crown!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai61_Any_Default","They're doing it - the damn ritual!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai62_Any_Default","This is it, friends. This is when we make history - or die."
"Narration/&TheAerElai63_AcolyteEinar_Default","Einar guide us!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai64_AcolyteMaraike_Default","Maraike watch over us!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai65_AcolyteArun_Default","Arun lights our way!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai66_AcolytePakri_Default","Justice will prevail!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai67_Highclass_Default","For all my ancestors, I shall not fail!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai68_Sellsword_Default","To the bitter end!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai69_Lowlife_Default","Let's make this bitch pay once and for all."
"Narration/&TheAerElai70_Spy_Default","Let's neutralize this guy."
"Narration/&TheAerElai71_Academic_Default","If we were destined to fail, we would have perished already."
"Narration/&TheAerElai72_Philosopher_Default","We'll venture where no one has been before!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai73_Lawmaker_Default","This chaos will end - today!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai74_Any_Default","We did it!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai75_Any2_Default","The Magister!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai76_Any2_Default","He's coming back to life!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai77_Magister_NPC","Hold."
"Narration/&TheAerElai78_Any3_Default","What?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai79_Any4_Default","The Rift, it's open!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai80_Any3_Default","No! "
"Narration/&TheAerElai81_Magister_NPC","HOLD."
"Narration/&TheAerElai82_Any_Default","I thought that was it!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai83_Any2_Default","He said hold! We need to hold!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai84_Any_Default","Against a whole army?"
"Narration/&TheAerElai85_Any3_Default","Look!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai86_Any3_Default","He's closing the Rift!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai87_Authority_Default","Protect the Magister - nothing else matters!"
"Narration/&TheAerElai88_Magister_NPC","I was right about you."
"Narration/&TheAerElai89_Magister_NPC","I must go, now."
"Narration/&TheAerElai90_Magister_NPC","Take care of Solasta. Take care of your world."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Starter_Default","Hello Annie."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Quartermaster_NPC","You're back! How did it go?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Starter_Default","Well… Captain Henrik is dead, I'm sorry."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Quartermaster_NPC","Oh. Who's in charge, then?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_Starter_Default","You might have to wait before going to Caer Lem, I'm afraid."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Quartermaster_NPC","I see."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Quartermaster_NPC","Well, not your fault. Thanks for the heads-up."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Starter_Default","You're welcome."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_1_Starter_Default","We wanted to talk about Caer Lem."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_2_Quartermaster_NPC","I'm all ears."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_3_Starter_Default","No one's there anymore…"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_4_Quartermaster_NPC","Ah, you want to claim the place?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_5_Starter_Default","How does it work again?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_6_Quartermaster_NPC","We go there and scavenge everything you didn't take, then you get a percentage."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_7_Starter_Default","We can't promise you it's safe."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_8_Quartermaster_NPC","It never is."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_9_Quartermaster_NPC","Once we get there, we'll set up an outpost of our own."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_10_Quartermaster_NPC","I'll check with the Council first, but thanks anyway."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_11_Starter_Default","What do we do next?"
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_12_Quartermaster_NPC","Once we've done our work, I'll let you know."
"Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_13_Quartermaster_NPC","You'll just have to come by and collect your share."
"Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_01","I think… this is what the Crown showed me."
"Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_02","So, not one of the gems?"
"Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_03","Obviously."
"Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_04","Do you feel anything else?"
"Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_05","Yes."
"Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_06","Alright - let's go, then."
"Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_07","I'm afraid not."
"Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_08","That's a problem."
"Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_09","Let's go back to the Council. We have to tell them."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_1_Annie_NPC","I have great need of you, my friends."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_2_Any_Default","What's going on?"
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_3_Annie_NPC","One of our teams has been attacked and is stranded in the Badlands."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_4_Any_Default","Oh, where?"
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_5_Annie_NPC","It's a bit beyond Caer Lem, not that far into the Badlands."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_6_Annie_NPC","They found a legendary place - the lost city of Telema!"
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_7_Annie_NPC","No one really knows what it was, but the name appears in many old texts."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_8_Annie_NPC","So they started exploring."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_9_Annie_NPC","One of them came back yesterday..."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_10_Annie_NPC","...he had lost an arm."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_11_Annie_NPC","He told me they'd been attacked and his leader sent him to get help."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_12_Annie_NPC","Alas, Telema is many days from here."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_13_Any_Default","Do you think they're still alive?"
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_14_Annie_NPC","I don't know, but I'd like you to go and find out."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_15_Annie_NPC","If they're alive, bring them back."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_16_Annie_NPC","If not... I'll send for their bodies."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_17_Annie_NPC","Anyway, the place is yours to explore. I expect it contains many treasures."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_18_Any_Default","Well, I suppose we can do that for our friends the Scavengers."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_19_Annie_NPC","That would make you part of the family, I promise."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_20_Any_Default","All right, let's hope we find them alive."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_1_Cynical_Default","Good old Hector, eh?"
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_2_Any_Default","Let's search him. We might find something to explain all this."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_3_Any_Default","Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_4_Any_Default","Soraks?"
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_5_Any_Default","At least we saved two of them."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_6_Cynical_Default","The best ones, I'm sure."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_7_Judgmental_Default","Shut up!"
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_8_Any_Default","Let's go back and tell Annie."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_1_Annie_NPC","My friends, you did it!"
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_2_Any_Default","Lena and Dek are already here?"
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_3_Annie_NPC","I received a message. They're safely back in Coparann."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_4_Any_Default","So they told you about Hector."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_5_Annie_NPC","Yes. Another friend lost..."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_6_Any_Default","You mean Arwin Merton?"
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_7_Annie_NPC","Never mind me. This was the Soraks, I know."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_8_Any_Default","Actually, we found proof that it was."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_9_Annie_NPC","Oh... and you saved two of my kids, I shall never forget."
"Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_10_Any_Default","We must go, Annie. See you!"
"Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_1_Any_Default","Are you the local… boss of the Scavengers?"
"Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_2_Milan_NPC","You could say that."
"Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_3_Milan_NPC","Not boss of much, I'm afraid."
"Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_4_Milan_NPC","We used to have adventurers raiding around here, but now there's just one."
"Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_5_Any_Default","One?"
"Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_6_Milan_NPC","She's around somewhere. You might run into her."
"Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_7_Any_Default","We did find an interesting place, though - an old Tirmarian monastery."
"Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_8_Milan_NPC","Yeah?"
"Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_9_Milan_NPC","Tell me where. We'll take care of it."
"Narration/&PriestessOfPakri1_Priestess_NPC","The law provides, adventurers!"
"Narration/&PriestessOfPakri2_Pakri_Default","Pakri preserve us!"
"Narration/&PriestessOfPakri4_Priestess_NPC","May the owl watch over you, faithful one."
"Narration/&PriestessOfPakri3_Priestess_NPC","May you find the answers you seek, adventurers."
"Narration/&PriestOfMaraike1_Priest_NPC","There's life yet, adventurers!"
"Narration/&PriestOfMaraike2_Maraike_Default","Maraike smile on you!"
"Narration/&PriestOfMaraike3_Priest_NPC","Lady of life! A follower of the goddess."
"Narration/&PriestOfMaraike4_Priest_NPC","Walk in life, adventurers."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_1_MayorBrightspark_NPC","Ah - deputies!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_2_Philosopher_Default","Clear skies, lady mayor!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_3_MayorBrightspark_NPC","Hem. Well, a renowned mind of Caer Cyflen has asked to see you."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_4_MayorBrightspark_NPC","I believe you know him - Galeafin Pureheart?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_5_Philosopher_Default","Indeed! A very fine mind and a beloved teacher!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_6_MayorBrightspark_NPC","Well, he's heard about your exploits and would like to talk to you."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_7_Philosopher_Default","Gladly! It will be good to see my old teacher! Clear skies!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_8_MayorBrightspark_NPC","Clear skies! "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_1_Philosopher_Default","Clear skies! We would like to meet Master Pureheart!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_2_Butler_NPC","You don't have an appointment? Who shall I announce?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_3_Philosopher_Default","A companion of the third enlightenment!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_4_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","Clear skies, my student! To what do I owe the pleasure? "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_5_Philosopher_Default","Mayor Bright-Spark asked us to visit you."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_6_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","Ah yes, this matter for the Council! "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_7_Philosopher_Default","What matter? "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_8_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","The matter of evil, and what motivates people to choose evil."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_9_Philosopher_Default","A weighty matter indeed!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_10_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","Yes, and I need your help! Tell me about your missions!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_11_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","I am cleared to hear everything! "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_12_Philosopher_Default","Well… it all began at Caer Lem…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_13_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","Many thanks! You gave me much to ponder. We shall meet again soon!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_14_Philosopher_Normal","Clear skies, master!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_15_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","Clear skies to you!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_1_Philosopher_Normal","Clear skies, Master Pureheart. You sent for us? "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC","Yes, indeed! I would like more…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC","…details about your dealings with the Sorr-Akkath."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_4_Philosopher_Normal","Certainly. How goes your research?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC","You gave me much to consider. But I need more…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_6_Galeafin_NPC","…hence this invitation"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC","There is much talk about Sorr-Akkath cruelty…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC","Did you witness it first hand?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_9_Philosopher_Normal","Alas, quite often! When they fight…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_10_Philosopher_Normal","They enjoy inflicting pain before killing!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC","But why, why so much suffering? "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_12_Philosopher_Normal","We think it is the will of their god, Sorr-Tarr."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_13_Galeafin_NPC","He expects them to spread terror…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_14_Philosopher_Normal","…so he can influence and…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_15_Philosopher_Normal","…pervert humans… control them."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_16_Galeafin_NPC","Humans, you say? "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_17_Philosopher_Normal","Yes - others seem less susceptible…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_18_Philosopher_Normal","… from what we understand of them!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_19_Galeafin_NPC","And so he relies on cruelty to… to do what? "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_20_Philosopher_Normal","To gain a hold! Those he can't control, he blackmails or breaks their will!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_21_Galeafin_NPC","Fascinating…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_22_Philosopher_Normal","Does it help?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_23_Galeafin_NPC","Oh, yes, very much."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_24_Galeafin_NPC","Thank you very much."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_25_Philosopher_Normal","Until next time, then, Master!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_1_Philosopher_Default","Clear skies, Master!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC","Clear skies!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC","We live in fascinating times!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_4_Philosopher_Default","Too true!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC","So, about our last meeting… "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_6_Philsopher_Insight_Success_Automatic_Default","Still troubled, Master?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC","Yes, indeed."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC","I have had occasion to witness… certain things."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_9_Philosopher_Default","What things?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_10_Galeafin_NPC","I am not entirely sure. Violent rituals…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC","…they reminded me of what you said."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_12_Galeafin_NPC","About cruelty and Sorr-Tarr's ways."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_13_Philosopher_Default","Master! You're scaring me, now!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_14_Galeafin_NPC","I need to think! Can you come back tomorrow?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_15_Philosopher_Default","Of course!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_16_Any_Default","You realize something very bad might be happening to him?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_17_Philosopher_Default","I know. Let's just… come back tomorrow."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_1_Philosopher_Default","Clear skies! "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_2_Galeafin_NPC","Ah, my friend. Let me introduce Lady Illoreth, my paramour! "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_3_Philosopher_Default","Master?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_4_Illoreth_NPC","Clear skies, senior deputies!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_5_Philosopher_Default","Why do you call us that? "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_6_Illoreth_NPC","Because you are the reason I was sent after Galeafin, the most gentle soul on Solasta."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_7_InsightSuccessDC15_Default","I knew there was some treachery afoot here!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_8_InsightFailDC15_Default","What?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_9_Philosopher_Default","You'd better explain yourself quickly!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_10_Illoreth_NPC","I am an infiltrator from the Coven of Arivad!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_11_Selfpres_Default","They're here in Caer Cyflen?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_12_Illoreth_NPC","I was to seduce Galeafin to make him work for us!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_13_Illoreth_NPC","But instead, he changed me!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_14_Illoreth_NPC","He showed me that even a corrupted soul like mine still had some good. "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_15_Illoreth_NPC","And I won't let any harm come to him!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_16_Philosopher_Default","How can we believe you?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_17_Illoreth_NPC","I am not the danger! "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_18_Illoreth_NPC","The Coven will soon ask me to bring him in to turn him!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_19_Philosopher_Default","And?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_20_Illoreth_NPC","I can take you there - right to a splinter cell of the Coven!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_21_InsightSuccessDC15_Default","What do you want? "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_22_Illoreth_NPC","Just to be free - to make a new life somewhere else."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_23_Illoreth_NPC","We are too well known to stay here, but we want to stay together!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_24_Illoreth_NPC","The Coven knew of your mission and sent me to get information from you…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_25_Illoreth_NPC","I am not sure I am the only agent who knows…"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_26_Illoreth_NPC","…and Galeafin must disappear to be safe."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_27_Philosopher_Default","Do you truly want to leave, Master?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_28_Galeafin_NPC","Yes. Where Illoreth goes, I shall follow! "
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_29_Philosopher_Default","Very well, we shall come when you send for us!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_1_Philosopher_Default","Is it time?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_3_Philosopher_Default","And once inside?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_4_Illoreth_NPC","Wait for my signal!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_5_Illoreth_NPC","And until then, let me speak."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_1_Guard_NPC","State your business!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_2_Illoreth_NPC","Glory of souls!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_3_Guard_NPC","Power to the One!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_4_Illoreth_NPC","We're running late! Are we the last?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_5_Guard_NPC","Yes! All are awaiting your guest."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_7_Illoreth_NPC","New recruits."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_8_Guard_NPC","It's one at a time, you know the rules!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_9_Illoreth_NPC","Indeed, I know them."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_10_Illoreth_BANTER","Follow me to the basement."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_11_Sarcastic_BANTER","Let me guess - that was the signal!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_1_Any_Default","Look at this! Marshal Sunblaze will be delighted!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_2_Cynical_Default","Or scared to death!"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_3_Selfpres_Default","Where's Illoreth?"
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_4_Any_Default","I suppose she grabbed her reward… she ran."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_5_Philosopher_Default","Farewell, Master."
"Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_6_Philosopher_Default","May your wisdom serve you well, now."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_01_Default","What's this? A shrine?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_02_Default","Someone here worshipped Arun, a long time ago."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_03_Default","That someone ruined their own shrine?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_04_Default","Maybe it was just the cataclysm."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_05_Default","There's a small chest, here."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_1_Acolyte_Default","Clear skies, Chaplain Lark! You wanted to see me? "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_2_DalonLark_NPC","Clear skies! Yes, thank you for coming so fast."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_3_DalonLark_NPC","Remember that monastery near Coparann?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_4_Acolyte_Default","The Tirmarian ruins? Of course."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_5_DalonLark_NPC","There was a cemetery there."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_6_Acolyte_Default","Chaplain Ardentfire, Priest of Arun, would like to meet you about it."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_7_DalonLark_NPC","I shall go to him right away! Clear skies! "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_8_Acolyte_Default","Even if I don't pray to Arun, I'm happy to be of service."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_9_DalonLark_NPC","Clear skies! Einar guards you all! "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC","Ah, there you are!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default","Chaplain Dalon Lark told us you'd like to talk?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC","Many thanks for coming! "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Rogar_NPC","It's about the Sunblaze Monastery."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Acolyte_Default","We're all ears!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC","The Scavengers said that many tombs in the cemetery bore the name of the Darwaz family."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Acolyte_Default","And?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_8_Rogar_NPC","Emtan Darwaz ruled this monastery…"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_9_Rogar_NPC","He was a renowned prelate on Tirmar."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_10_Rogar_NPC","The heads of the Church searched for him for years."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_11_Rogar_NPC","Then he was considered to be lost, either left on the home world…"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_12_Rogar_NPC","…or killed in the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_13_Rogar_NPC","Now, we know he was alive - he buried his brothers and family in the Badlands!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_14_Acolyte_Default","A sad tale, for sure."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_15_Rogar_NPC","Worse. As this cursed symbol suggests."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_16_Rogar_NPC","I prayed for his soul, and Arun sent me a sign."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_17_Acolyte_Default","A sign?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_18_Rogar_NPC","Chaplain Darwaz' soul never joined Arun. It is trapped."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_19_Rogar_NPC","He might have cursed his own symbol."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_20_Rogar_NPC","The souls of his brothers too, wander, somewhere in this land."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_21_Rogar_NPC","Someone needs to go and cleanse their remains with holy water."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_22_Acolyte_Default","Will that suffice?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_23_Rogar_NPC","Not if Emtan is indeed cursed, his soul will be too angry."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_24_Rogar_NPC","Then you'll need to reason with him. I imbued his symbol with Arun's magic - use it as proof."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_25_Acolyte_Default","And if he doesn't listen to reason? "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_26_Rogar_NPC","Then - and only then - should you destroy him. "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_27_Acolyte_Default","We will do what is necessary."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_28_Rogar_NPC","May Arun's fire warm your heart! "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_29_Acolyte_Default","Clear skies!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_1_Sarcastic_Default","Did we forget to close the door on our last visit? "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_2_HighestIntOrAny_Default","Never opened it!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_3_Sarcastic_Default","Well, someone's dropped by!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_5_Acolyte_Default","Let's cleanse those tombs with holy water!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_6_Sarcastic_Default","Not many remains left for the prayer!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_7_Acolyte_Default","You had to say it! Get ready, people!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_8_Sarcastic_Default","We're not going to try talking to them first? "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9a_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Success_Default","Zombies don't talk!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9b_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Failure_Default","No harm in trying, I guess."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_11_Acolyte_Default","May the light of the gods free your souls!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_12_Sarcastic_Default","Sheesh! Don't pray for me if I die! "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_1_Emtan_NPC","Who are you to disturb our eternal rest?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_2_Acolyte_Default","A follower of the gods, hoping to save your soul!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_3_Emtan_NPC","There are no gods in this place, fool! "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_4_Acolyte_Default","Do you truly believe that? "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Emtan_NPC","Of course! Otherwise, they would have answered us in our hour of need! "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Acolyte_Default","Did they not? "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5b_Emtan_NPC","I prayed and never got an answer!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6a_Acolyte_Default","Yes, it did!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7a_Emtan_NPC","Liar!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8a_Acolyte_Default","Did you not have water and the means to grow food?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9a_Emtan_NPC","Barely!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8b_Acolyte_Default","Were monsters not kept at bay from your valley?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9b_Emtan_NPC","We heard them roam at night! "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8c_Acolyte_Default","Weren't you spared the worst of the mana collapse?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9c_Emtan_NPC","What?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_10_Acolyte_Default","And yet you survived how many years here? "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_11_Emtan_NPC","But my prayers weren't answered!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_12_Acolyte_Default","Yes, they were! You were just too mad with grief to see it!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6b_Acolyte_Default","Behold, the power of Arun, apostate!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7b_Emtan_NPC","It won't work, you fool!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_13_Emtan_NPC","Arun! The lord is still here!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_14_Acolyte_Default","It is time for you to enjoy your final rest, Emtan Darwaz, Acolyte of Arun!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_15_Emtan_NPC","Thank you…"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Acolyt_Normal","Clear skies, Chaplain Ardentfire!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC","Clear skies! Did you bring peace to those troubled souls? "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default","Yes, all of them are with the gods now! "
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC","And Emtan?"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Acolyt_Normal","Saved. He is with Arun."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Rogar_NPC","Many thanks, I will call his name during prayers!"
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC","Tragedy. The curse of Sorr-Tarr hurts us, still."
"Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Failed","We couldn't bring him back. He's gone."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest1_Belmont_NPC","You? I know you!"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest2_Spy_Default","What?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest3_Belmont_NPC","You were at the embassy! An aide or something… "
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest4_Spy_Default","You're mistaken. I'm a Council deputy."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest5_Belmont_NPC","You can't fool me, I never forget a face."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest6_Anyother_Default","What's going on, friend?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest7_Spy_Default","Never mind."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest8_Belmont_NPC","That same week, the Gallivan envoy somehow got hold of our plans for the trade treaty… "
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest9_Spy_Default","Stop bothering us - we're guests of the princess."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest10_Noble_Default","He's a Belmont. Be careful - they're a powerful family in the Snow Alliance."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest11_Belmont_NPC","This isn't over. Now I found you, we'll settle this!"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest12_Anyother_Default","Anything we should know?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest13_Spy_Default","Old story."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest14_Anyother_Default","Look, if this is going to be a problem, we need to fix it - together."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest15_Anyother_Default","I agree."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest16_Spy_Default","All right, then I'll need to see someone at the Gallivan embassy."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest17_Guard_NPC","Who goes there?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest18_Spy_Default","I'd like to see Ambassador Crawley."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest19_Guard_NPC","Council business?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest20_Spy_Default","Inaudible"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest21_Guard_NPC","Follow me."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest22_Anyother_Default","Just like that?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest23_Spy_Default","Shut up and follow."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest24_Joran_NPC","I'll be damned. Senior deputy of the Legacy Council."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest25_Spy_Default","Nice to see you, too."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest26_Joran_NPC","Can't say I expected your visit."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest27_Spy_Default","I bumped into Belmont at the Palace residence."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest28_Joran_NPC","And?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest29_Spy_Default","He seems to suspect me over the stolen treaty plans."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest30_Joran_NPC","Seems to?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest31_Spy_Default","He's pretty eager to pin it on me."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest32_Joran_NPC","We can't let that happen."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest33_Spy_Default","That's why I'm here."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest34_Joran_NPC","Them?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest35_Spy_Default","Friends. Trustworthy."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest36_Joran_NPC","You have to take him out."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest37_Joran_NPC","I can suggest a course of action."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest38_Joran_NPC","You just need to plant something in the New Empire's embassy."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest39_Spy_Default","Oh, is that all?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest40_Joran_NPC","Unless you have friends in the Silent Whisper."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest41_Spy_Default","I might."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest42_Joran_NPC","Once it's in the right hands, this will kill our friend Belmont's credibility."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest43_Spy_Default","It looks like you have this all figured out."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest44_Joran_NPC","I always plan for every contingency."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest45_Joran_NPC","We should go."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest46_Joran_NPC","Then this time it's farewell for good."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest47_Selfpres_Default","You really want to break into the New Empire's embassy?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest48_Pragmatic_Default","This is crazy."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest49_Spy_DaliatLives","We can ask Daliat. I think he'll help us."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest50_Starter_Normal","That's not an embassy."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest51_Spy_Normal","Just not its best side."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest52_Noble_Slang","Sewers? Really? How did you know about this?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest53_Spy_Slang","Mind your own business. This way. Stay low."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest54_Spy_Formal","Remember, if we're discovered, we're as good as dead."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest55_Spy_Formal","This is it."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest56_Spy_Normal","Let's hope this works."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest57_Spy_Slang","Let's get out of here."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest58_Daliat_NPC","Greetings, colleague."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest59_Spy_Default","I'm not your colleague, Daliat. You know that."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest60_Daliat_NPC","Sure. What can I do for you?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest61_Spy_Default","You know Lord Belmont?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest62_Daliat_NPC","Ambassador Belmont? Of course."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest63_Spy_Default","We have something on Belmont that you might like. Not flattering."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest64_Daliat_NPC","Nice. What's the catch?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest65_Spy_Default","I need you to release it right away."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest66_Daliat_NPC","Right now? No long-term leverage?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest67_Spy_Default","That's right."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest68_Daliat_NPC","I'll need you to do something for me, then."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest69_Spy_Default","I'm listening."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest70_Daliat_NPC","Some… former colleagues are running an operation from a base nearby."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest71_Daliat_NPC","I need them dead."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest72_Spy_Default","We're not murderers."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest73_Daliat_NPC","They're traitors to the Silent Whisper. Ruthless bastards, too."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest74_Spy_Default","Enough to die, just like that?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest75_Daliat_Default","Your choice. Do this for me and I'll take care of the Belmont thing."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest76_Spy_Default","Fair enough."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest77_Spy_Default","Hey! Any news?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest78_Daliat_NPC","It's done. Your… friends won't be a problem anymore."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest79_Spy_Default","Good! I knew I could depend on you."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest80_Daliat_NPC","That tip on Belmont is so good. He's as good as dead."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest81_Daliat_NPC","Pleasure working with you, my friends."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest82_Spy_Default","See you, Daliat."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest83_Spy_Default","Is Lord Belmont around?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest84_Butler_NPC","He had to… return home."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest85_Spy_Default","In a rush?"
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest86_Butler_NPC","Indeed."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest87_Spy_Default","Thank you, Ravensworth."
"Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest88_Butler_NPC","You're welcome, deputies."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_1_Bagmordah_NPC","Clear skies, friends! I have a letter for someone who fought at Sandreed."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_2_Sellsword_Normal","That'd be me. Who wrote me?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_3_Bagmordah_NPC","Mildred Warmhearth, innkeeper at Coparann's Strike True tavern. Know her?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_4_Sellsword_Normal","Sure do. Well, friends, who's in for a trip back there?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Clear skies to you, adventurers! You got my letter?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_6_Sellsword_Normal","Clear skies! What's it all about?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Well, I knew your parents - and I know about the events that led to their deaths!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_8_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","You knew my parents? "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_9_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","What events?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","Their deaths?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_11_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","You knew my parents? "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Sure did. They had a house in the Vale, you know. "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_13_Sellsword_Normal","A house?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","I wasn't sure the first time I saw you… now I am."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Your parents were merchants, and you sometimes traveled with them."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","They worked a circuit from the Principality to the Marches."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","They were shrewd and successful. "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_18_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","So the house belongs to you now, I guess! "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_19_ChoiceB_Normal","What events? What are you talking about?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_20_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Fifteen years ago, Coparann was threatened by an orcish horde."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_21_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","They hit us hard, and almost overran the defenses!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_22_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","If the Stonefist company hadn't shown up when they did…"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_23_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","They broke the siege, but we'd already lost a lot of people."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_24_ChoiceC_Normal","How did they die?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_25_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","They died right after the siege. "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_26_Sellsword_Sellsword","After? Not during? "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_27_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","No… I… How can I put this?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_28_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Success","They were… responsible. "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_29_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Fail","Come on - spit it out!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_30_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","Well, your parents had been spying for the orcs!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_31_Sellsword_Sellsword","What? No! How? Who said? "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_32_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","That's the hardest part."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_33_Sellsword_Sellsword","What do you mean?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_34_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","It was you. Your testimony sealed their fate."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_35_Sellsword_Sellsword","What? Me? How?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_36_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","A seemingly innocent remark, but it led the Ceannard's spymaster to suspect your parents."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_37_Sellsword_Sellsword","How is it possible that I don't remember any of it?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_38_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","The Ceannard took pity on you and made you drink an elixir of forgetfulness."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_39_Sellsword_Sellsword","Very potent, clearly. I don't remember shit from my childhood."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_40_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","Yes. The Ceannard miscalculated the dose."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_41_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","The Baron sent you away, and provided for your education."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_42_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","He was a former mercenary, and he sent you to learn the same trade. "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_43_Sellsword_Sellsword","I guess I should thank him for bleeding in Sandreed… so, there's a house?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_44_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","All yours! No one knew where to find you until now. It's been kept in good order, waiting."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_45_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","Your parents gave me this before they went to meet their fate."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_46_Sellsword_Sellsword","What does that mean, ""resist temptation""? "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_47_Any_Insight_25_Success_Any_Insight_25_Success","Bribery or Sorak evil perhaps?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_48_Any_Insight_25_Failure_Any_Insight_25_Failure","Bribery?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_49_Sellsword_Sellsword","It was orcs! Let's go search the house for clues!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_50_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","You should tell Sergeant Nikannen who you are, by the way. I told him you'd come."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_1_Sellsword_Slang","Clear skies to you, Sarge!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC","You, too! What can I do for you today, my friend? "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_3_Sellsword_Normal","I need the keys to my house in the Vale. Mildred told me."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_4_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Oh, it's you? You've grown - well, of course you have! Here - take this note to the Archivist!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_5_Sellsword_Normal","Thanks, Sarge!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_1_Sellsword_Slang","Clear skies, Master Archivist!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_2_AlanMiller_NPC","Clear skies! What can I do for you? "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_3_Sellsword_Normal","Here - from Sergeant Nikannen!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_4_AlanMiller_NPC","I see! Give me a moment, I just need to go into the archives."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_5_AlanMiller_NPC","Here you go! "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_6_Sellsword_Normal","Thanks! Clear skies!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_1_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal","Nice house!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_2_Sellsword_Normal","Strange. It feels familiar and unfamiliar at the same time."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_3_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal","Let's go inside!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_4_Sellsword_Normal","I got something."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_5_Sellsword_Normal","Some stuff, and a note…"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__1_Any_Default","Soraks!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__2_Any_Default","So they're involved, for sure!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__3_Sellsword_Default","I'll find the rest and kill them!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_1_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Clear skies! Did you go to the house?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_2_Sellsword_Normal","Yes - and I found this note!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_3_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Interesting - and surprising!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_4_Sellsword_Normal","Surprising? "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Well, why hide it? They could have shown it to the Ceannard!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_6_Sellsword_Normal","Anyway, this was written by the real spy."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","So what?"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_8_CynicOrElse_Slang","Good luck finding the writer!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_9_Sellsword_Normal","Yes, that's it! "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_10_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","What do you mean? "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_11_Sellsword_Normal","The note - the writing reveals the spy."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Then why didn't your parents use it at the trial? It would have saved their lives!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_13_Sellsword_Normal","Because they wanted to keep me safe!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Then they must have known that the spy was present at their trial!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","You know… paperwork."
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","The Ceannard, he swears by the rule of law! "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Every trial is recorded. It's all in the archives!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_18_Sellsword_Normal","So we have our list of suspects!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_19_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Exactly!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_1_AllanMiller_NPC","Clear skies! What can I do for you today? "
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_2_Sellsword_Normal","We need to consult the archives!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_3_AllanMiller_NPC","Give me the year and the case, and I'll get whatever you need!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_4_AcademicOrElse_Normal","Is that your writing? I've never seen anything so neat!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_5_AllanMiller_NPC","It's my job. An archive needs to be clear and legible!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_6_Sellsword_Slang","Right - so your agents don't misunderstand your orders. Traitor!"
"Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_7_AllanMiller_NPC","Ah, you're too smart for you own good."
"Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_1_Ceannard_NPC","Ah - I expected you."
"Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_2_Sellsword_Default","Ceannard. "
"Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_3_Ceannard_NPC","You know the truth. I hope you can forgive me."
"Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_4_Ceannard_NPC","To think the Soraks were already here…"
"Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_5_Ceannard_NPC","…manipulating me…"
"Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_6_Sellsword_Default","It's in the past."
"Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_7_Sellsword_Default","Though I'd like you to restore my family's name."
"Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_8_Ceannard_NPC","The paperwork is under way."
"Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_9_Ceannard_NPC","Their names will be on a memorial I intend to build."
"Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_10_Sellsword_Default","Great thanks."
"Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_11_Ceannard_NPC","Clear skies, my friends."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start1_Bagmordah_NPC","Ah, there you are! Clear skies, my friends!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start2_Bagmordah_NPC","Someone came to see you."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start3_Academic_Default","Me? Who?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start4_Bagmordah_NPC","An old acquaintance, I gather. Master Dackin."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start5_Bagmordah_NPC","He said he'd wait for you at Sunblaze Court."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start6_Academic_Default","Oh! Thanks for the message. Stay in the light!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start7_Anyother_Default","Everything all right?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start8_Academic_Default","Like she said - an old acquaintance."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster1_Dackin_NPC","You came! I wondered, considering your new… rank."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster2_Academic_Default","How are you, Master?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster3_Dackin_NPC","It's nice that you pretend to care…"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster4_Academic_Default","Are you going to hate me forever?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster5_Dackin_NPC","I don't hate you. I just…"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster6_Dackin_NPC","…well, it was your right to leave and…"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster7_Dackin_NPC","…pursue a life of adventure."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster8_Dackin_NPC","Even if it wastes your academic talent."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster9_Academic_Default","It serves me well, thanks to you."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster10_Dackin_NPC","Maybe. Still, I'm without an assistant. "
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster11_Dackin_NPC","Times have been hard."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster12_Dackin_NPC","The Guild offered me a posting… south."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster13_Academic_Default","You're not getting your department chair?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster14_Dackin_NPC","Evidently not - unless I can make a major contribution."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster15_Dackin_NPC","That's why I wanted to see you."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster16_Dackin_NPC","I heard you went to Caer Lem, in the Marches."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster17_Academic_Default","That's right."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster18_Dackin_NPC","There is an old Tirmarian tower there."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster19_Academic_Default","Oh, yes. Very impressive, too."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster20_Dackin_NPC","If I could just explore it - bring something back…"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster21_Dackin_NPC","Something the Guild couldn't ignore…"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster22_Dackin_NPC","I would have a chance at this chair."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster23_Dackin_NPC","The Scavengers say it's safe now. I can go."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster24_Dackin_NPC","But once there, I'll need… well, some specific expertise."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster25_Academic_Default","…and that's us."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster26_Dackin_NPC","It could salvage my career!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster27_Academic_Default","Of course. I owe you that much, Master."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster28_Dackin_NPC","Thanks. Find me at Caer Lem, then. I'll be ready!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster29_Academic_Default","We'll see you there. Stay in the light, Master!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem1_Friendly_Default","Clear skies, friend!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem2_Bertram_NPC","Clear skies, deputy!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem3_Greed_WRITTEN","How's business in Caer Lem?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem4_Friendly_WRITTEN","What's your name?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem5_Nosy_WRITTEN","Did you find the secret passage?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","Have you seen Master Dackin?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem7_Greed_Choice","How's business been since we… cleaned up the place?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem8_Bertram_NPC","Not bad! Some folks are starting to explore a little further."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem9_Bertram_NPC","Though this… Sorak attack still has people nervous."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem10_Bertram_NPC","Still, there's been no sign of them since…"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem11_Bertram_NPC","…so we mostly pretend it didn't happen."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem12_Pragmatic_Default","Huh - good for you."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem13_Bertram_NPC","I'm Bertram."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem14_Friendly_Default","Good to meet you, Bertram."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem15_Bertram_NPC","I think so, but… your Sorak buddies seem to have blocked it."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem16_Bertram_NPC","They must have dug a little too hard in there."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem17_Greed_Default","I'm sure we can solve this little problem."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem18_Bertram_NPC","The Antiquarian? Sure."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem19_Bertram_NPC","He's in the courtyard."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem20_Bertram_NPC","He's been staring at the tower…"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem21_Bertram_NPC","…trying to figure a way to get up there."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem22_Bertram_NPC","But he can't fly… wait, can he?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem23_Academic_Default","Seems not."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster1_Dackin_NPC","There you are!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster2_Academic_Default","Are you ready for this?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster3_Dackin_NPC","I am. Any idea how to get up there?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster4_Academic_Default","One or two."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster5_Dackin_NPC","I tried to think of a way, but…"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster6_Dackin_NPC","…still, this place is incredible!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster7_Dackin_NPC","Did you notice that there was minor gate just here in the courtyard?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster8_Academic_Default","As a matter of fact, I did."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster9_Pragmatic_Default","Let's get to it, if you don't mind."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower1_Dackin_NPC","Fantastic… it looks like… well, another world."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower2_Dackin_NPC","You must have seen so much!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower3_Academic_Default","I have. But this is still…"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower4_Dackin_NPC","…fascinating."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower5_Anyother_Default","Well, I see where you got your passion for learning!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower6_Academic_Default","Let's look around."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower7_Academic_Default","Gather all the antiques we can."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary1_Dackin_NPC","By all the gods!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary2_Dackin_NPC","This is really something. "
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary3_Academic_Default","It explains the library we found down in the caves."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary4_Dackin_NPC","The place seems… dangerous."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary5_Academic_Default","Definitely. Be ready for a fight."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary6_Dackin_NPC","Wait - you know me. I don't fight."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight1_Academic_Default","Are you all right, Master?"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight2_Dackin_NPC","I am… alive, or so it seems."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight3_Academic_Default","Those are quite common in the Marches."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight4_Dackin_NPC","Just tell me there's something valuable down here!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight5_Academic_Default","Oh, I think you'll be happy."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending1_Dackin_NPC","This is… more than I dared hope for… so much more!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending2_Academic_Default","Good! I think the Guild will treat you a little better now. They'd lick your boots for a look at these!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending3_Dackin_NPC","I'd like to see them do that - one or two of them, in particular…"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending4_Dackin_NPC","These will be perfect! Take whatever else you want - I have plenty!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending5_Dackin_NPC","…And thank you. "
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending6_Academic_Default","You're welcome, Master."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending7_Dackin_NPC","I think it's time you stop calling me that, you know."
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending8_Academic_Default","Well, how about Chairman of the Guild, then? With these books…"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending9_Dackin_NPC","Stay in the light, my friend!"
"Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending10_Academic_Default","You, too!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start1_Merton_NPC","Hey! Interested in a little side-job?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start2_Player_Default","What kind of side-job?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start3_Merton_NPC","The kind that takes particular skills and contacts."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start4_Merton_NPC","In the - shall we say - involuntary gift business."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start5_Player_Default","Involuntary gift business'? That's just embarrassing."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start6_Player_Default","Say what you mean - the underworld, right?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start7_Merton_NPC","And there I was trying to be discreet."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start8_Lowlife_Default","Try harder. Suppose I do have the skills and contacts you're looking for?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start9_Merton_NPC","Go to Annie Bagmordah at the Scavengers."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start10_Merton_NPC","Tell her I sent you."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlifeb_Default","Merton says you got a problem."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Annie_NPC","Uh… Arwin…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Annie_NPC","What makes you think you can help?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlifeb_Default","Not saying I can, yet. But I know people."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Annie_NPC","People who can track down stolen goods?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Lowlifeb_Default","What kind of goods?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Annie_NPC","A sword. Imperial."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Annie_NPC","The guard has three diamonds. Probably magical."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Curious_Default","Probably? What does it probably do?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Annie_NPC","Never got a chance to find out."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Greedy_Default","You offering a reward?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie11_Annie_NPC","I'll make it worth your while."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie12_Joker_Default","Are you not the one supposed to bring back stuff?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie13_Annie_NPC","Very funny."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel1_Lowlife_Default","Hey, Nel! Still laughing?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel2_Nel_NPC","Like Misaye herself! You?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel3_Lowlife_NPC","Happy as a rat in a granary. Need an ear out."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel4_Nel_NPC","For?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel5_Lowlife_Default","A nice antique sword with three diamonds."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel6_Lowlife_Default","Hear anything?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel7_Nel_NPC","Something. Talk to Gorim."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel8_Joker_Default","So that's your former life, walking the streets?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel9_Lowlife_Default","And cutting the throats of people who crossed me."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlife_Default","Hey, Gorim! I'm in the market for a sword."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Lowlife_Default","A very particular one."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Gorim_NPC","How particular?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlife_Default","Imperial, three diamonds in the guard, probably magical."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Lowlife_Default","Sound familiar?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Gorim_NPC","Too expensive for me. I turned him down."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Lowlife_Default","He have a name?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Gorim_NPC","Didn't say. I told him to ask for Surespell at the Gravekeep's Cask."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Gorim_NPC","The Arcaneum has money."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Lowlife_Default","Thanks."

"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern2_Lowlife_Default","Back again?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern3_Karel_NPC","Has anyone been in asking for Surespell?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern4_Karel_NPC","The Arcaneum guy?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern5_Karel_NPC","Yes, as it happens. Over there. Still waiting, it seems."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern6_Lowlife_Default","Thanks."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern7_Lowlife_Default","I've been looking for you."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern8_Thief_NPC","I'm waiting for someone, and you're not him. Get lost."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern9_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","You have a stolen sword."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","Let's make a deal."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern11_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","You're in trouble."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern12_Intimidator_Answer1","Don't come the hard case with me. You won't win."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern13_Intimidator_Answer2","You have a sword that doesn't belong to you."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern14_Thief_Success","Listen, I don't want any trouble… "
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern15_Thief_Failure","You deaf or something? I said, get lost!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern16_Persuader_Answer1","You're waiting for someone to buy a sword."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern17_Persuader_Answer2","Old, three diamonds, probably magical. Am I right?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern18_Thief_Success","How do you…?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern19_Thief_Success2","Doesn't matter."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern20_Thief_Success2","What matters is, do you want a Council deputy owing you a favor?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern21_Thief_Success3","It had better be a pretty big favor."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern22_Thief_Failure","I can make better friends than you with a sword like that…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern23_Thief_Failure","…and get paid too!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern24_Deceiver_Answer1","It's about that very nice sword…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern25_Deceiver_Answer2","…that you're thinking of selling…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern26_Deceiver_Answer3","…to Heddlon Surespell of the Arcaneum."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern28_Deceiver_Success2","What matters is, do you want to end up nailed to a door in Fishtown?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern29_Thief_Success3","What?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern30_Deceiver_Success4","You see, the sword was already spoken for when you stole it from the Scavengers…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern31_Deceiver_Success5","…and a certain someone's going to be very disappointed if they don't get it as planned."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern32_Deceiver_Success6","The sort of someone who nails people to doors in Fishtown."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern33_Thief_NPC","Misaye's crooked dice! I… I can get it for you."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern34_Deceiver_Success7","Just tell me where to find it. Then it might be wise to leave town."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern35_Deceiver_Success8","I hear the Southern Isles are lovely at this time of year."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern36_Thief_Failure1","Ooh! I'm so scared. Sell your drivel somewhere else."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern37_Any_Allfailed","Perhaps you missed our nice badge, here."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern38_Thief_NPC","The Council? Oh, come on…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern39_Thief_NPC","It's in Misaye's temple for safekeeping."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern40_Thief_NPC","Ask Nel for a bowl of soup."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern41_Lowlife_Default","Nel? I just talked to him… I should have known…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern41_Cynical_Default","Bowl of soup? That's the worst password I've ever heard!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple1_Lowlife_Default","Hey, Nel. So, I'm supposed to ask you for, uh…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple2_Nel_NPC","A bowl of soup?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple3_Lowlife_Default","You knew? "
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple4_Nel_NPC","Of course! Misaye sees all!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple5_Lowlife_Default","And you didn't tell me because…?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple6_Nel_NPC","This was more fun!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple7_Lowlife_Default","For you and Misaye, I'm sure."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple8_Lowlife_Default","Well, I won't be a grouch about it."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple9_Nel_NPC","Aww! Misaye loves to tease a grouch!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple10_Nel_NPC","Ask properly!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple11_Lowlife_Default","Really?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple12_Nel_NPC","Rules are rules!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple13_Lowlife_Default","Rules - you? Oh, wait - only when it's fun, right?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple14_Nel_NPC","You're learning!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple15_Lowlife_Default","All right, then. chaplain Nel - may I please have a bowl of soup?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple16_Nel_NPC","Of course! It's in that chest."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple17_Lowlife_Default","This locked chest? I should have known."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple18_Lowlife_Default","Got it!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple19_Lowlife_Default","I can't get it…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple20_Nel_NPC","Make a donation to Misaye for luck?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple21_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","<i>Give 1 gold piece</i>"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","Refuse"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_Lowlife_Default","Take it, you crook."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple23_Lowlife_Default","I don't think so."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple24_Nel_NPC","Your coin made Misaye smile!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple25_Nel_NPC","Try again, Misaye will help, this time."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple26_Lowlife_Default","Still nothing!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple27_Nel_NPC","Maybe you need to be more generous!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple28_Nel_NPC","You probably used the wrong number…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple29_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","<i>Give 5 gold pieces</i>"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple30_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","Refuse"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple30_Nel_NPC","Fine. Let's hope your skills are up to it."
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple31_Nel_NPC","Have you trained in your skills since the last time?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple32_Nel_NPC","You're welcome. Misaye's laughing!"

"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest1_Lawkeeper_Default","Hey, shorty! You in the army?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest2_Stig_NPC","Don't call me that! I'm a Royal Guard, you know."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest3_Lawkeeper_Default","You… really? The Princess, and all?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest4_Stig_NPC","Yeah. Those your friends?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest5_Friendly_Default","We are. How do you know each other?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest6_Stig_NPC","You didn't tell them?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest7_Stig_NPC","We were in the City Guard together."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest8_Lawkeeper_Default","And we both… upgraded."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest9_Stig_NPC","Anyway, I need help."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest10_Stig_NPC","I think someone's rotten in the Guard."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest11_Selfpres_Default","That's reassuring…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest12_Pragmatic_Default","We have important things to do, mind you."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest13_Lawkeeper_Default","Hey, Stig is my friend!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest14_Pragmatic_Default","Fine."

"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest21_Any","So, what can we do to help?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest22_Stig_NPC","I have four suspects. Here are their names and posts."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest23_Stig_NPC","It won't be easy."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest24_Stig_NPC","They mustn't know I suspect them."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest25_Lawkeeper_Default","We'll check them out - no problem!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest26_Stig_NPC","Strike true!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge27_Cynical_Default","All right. Stig says he should be leaving soon."

"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge29_Lawful_Default","…let's find a spot with a good view and wait for the night."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge30_Cynical_Default","Now that's a conspiracy!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge31_Cynical_Default","There might be an angry husband."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge32_Cynical_Default","It might be worth an arrest."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge33_Lawkeeper_Default","Shut up!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance34_Friendly_Default","Clear skies!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance35_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","I know you - you're the Sorak killers!"

"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance37_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","What?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance38_Lawkeeper_Default","A little business of yours."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance39_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","Oh. Sure."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance40_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","Not here, though. Meet me at the promontory, tonight."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance41_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","Quiet place. I like it."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance42_Lawkeeper_Default","So, what have you got?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance43_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","In a rush, eh? All right. Here."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance44_Lawkeeper_Default","Booze? Really?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance45_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","Hey, you asked for it!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance46_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","My boss would kill me for selling New Empire liquor."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance47_Lawkeeper_Default","This isn't illegal?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance48_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","Of course not! Just… you know… Imperial. Slaver stuff."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance49_Lawkeeper_Default","Never mind. Our mistake. Sorry to waste your time."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk50_Drunk_NPC","This is my seat!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk51_Drunk_NPC","I always sit here!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk52_Drunk_NPC","You're a strange bunch, you know that?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk53_Drunk_NPC","Even stranger than that Arwin Merton."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk54_Drunk_NPC","Are you gonna say something?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk55_Drunk_NPC","Knew it. You Council pawns are fake."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk56_Drunk_NPC","Killed Soraks? Right. And I've got a dragon in my pocket."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk57_Drunk_NPC","Now you're pissing me off."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk58_Lawkeeper_Default","Well, I'm not sure he's smart enough to be corrupt."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk59_Any_Default","Think he can work? He can barely stand!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk60_Any_Default","Let's go and see, then."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk61_Lawkeeper_Default","What is he doing?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk62_Partner_Default","Hijacking a crate from a delivery."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk63_Lawkeeper_Default","Let's see what's in it."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk64_Lawkeeper_Default","Flowers?"

"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk66_Drunk_NPC","Hey! What are you doing?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk67_Persuasion_WRITTEN","We just want a share of the loot."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk68_Intimidation_WRITTEN","You're clearly a thief - admit it!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk69_Deception_WRITTEN","We're investigating you for Captain Ironshell."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk70_Default_WRITTEN","The question is, what are you doing?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk71_Persuasion_CHOICE","We got you. Let us take some of these and we'll keep quiet."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk72_Drunk_FAIL","You Council people really think you can do whatever you like, don't you?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk73_Intimidation_CHOICE","We caught you red-handed. Just confess."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk74_Intimidation_FAIL","You're a bunch of idiots, I'll confess that."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk75_Deception_FAIL","Captain Ironshell asked us to investigate you."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk76_Drunk_FAIL","Oh yeah? That's a good one. She asked me to bring this to the Palace."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk77_Default_FAIL","The question is, what are you doing?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk78_Drunk_FAIL","My job. What did you think I was doing?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk79_Lawkeeper_Default","Why did you pick this crate out of the delivery?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk80_Drunk_NPC","Oh, this one? "
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk81_Drunk_NPC","Let me think. "
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk82_Drunk_NPC","This is for her Royal Highness, going through Captain Ironshell directly."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk83_Drunk_NPC","I'm sure the Princess will appreciate you rummaging through her personal stuff."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk84_Drunk_NPC","As everyone knows, everything for her personal use is tax free."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk85_Cynical_Default","I knew that."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk86_Drunk_NPC","Ask the Captain. Go right ahead."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk87_Lawkeeper_Default","That won't be necessary. Carry on."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple88_TempleGuard_NPC","Rodric isn't here."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple89_TempleGuard_NPC","Rodric? He's on an errand."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple90_Any_Default","Nothing. We're wasting our time."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple91_Lawkeeper_Default","This Rodric, though - where is he?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple92_Any_Default","Let's check again."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple93_Lawkeeper_Default","You're Rodric?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple94_Alrin_NPC","Who's asking?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple95_Lawkeeper_Default","We're Council deputies…"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End96_Any_Default","What was that?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End97_Any_Default","He's not just a Guard, that's for sure!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End98_Arcana_Default","That's a shadowcaster trick! He can't be far!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End99_Lawkeeper_Default","Look for tracks."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End100_Lawkeeper_Default","A secret tunnel? We're on to something here!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End101_Lawkeeper_Default","What have you found?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End102_Any_Default","Enough to implicate Rodric and his friends."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End103_Any_Default","They were smuggling goods in and out of the Temple Quarter."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End104_Lawkeeper_Default","Hey, Stig!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End105_Stig_NPC","I heard what happened! Rodric's a shadowcaster?"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End106_Lawkeeper_Default","Rodric's a corpse. He attacked us with a bunch of his friends."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End107_Lawkeeper_Default","Take this. You can follow up and shut down his network."
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End108_Stig_NPC","Fantastic! Thanks for the help, my friends!"
"Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End109_Lawkeeper_Default","Stay in the light, Stig!"

"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start2_Aristocrat_Default","Lady Bright-Spark? How may we help you?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start3_Mayor_NPC","You could start by not calling me that."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start4_Aristocrat_Default","As you wish."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start5_Mayor_NPC","I have a messy business on my desk, and your name's on it."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start6_Aristocrat_Default","My name?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start7_Mayor_NPC","It's an inheritance…"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start8_Mayor_NPC","…with a bunch of people contesting the will."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start9_Aristocrat_Default","What? Who died?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start10_Mayor_NPC","The honorable Joan Tannerson."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start11_Aristocrat_Default","Oh. I see."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start12_Anyother_Default","Family?"

"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start15_Aristocrat_Default","Do I look like a lawyer?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start16_Cynical_Default","Wouldn't put it past you."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start17_Aristocrat_Default","What is the mess, exactly?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start18_Mayor_NPC","Tannerson left you everything, according to the will."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start19_Mayor_NPC","Her children aren't happy, and the notary is very… annoying."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start20_Mayor_NPC","So please - do something. Anything. Just make them stop harassing me."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start21_Mayor_NPC","I have more important things to deal with."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start22_Aristocrat_Default","Perhaps I should talk to the children first."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start23_Mayor_NPC","Do whatever you want, as long as it shuts this notary up!"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start24_Aristocrat_Default","Right. Thank you… my lady."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start25_Mayor_NPC","Tsss…"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew11_Aristocrat_Default","Drew! How are you holding up?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew12_Drew_NPC","Look - it's the famous heir. Should I bow?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew13_Aristocrat_Default","Listen, I have no idea…"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew14_Drew_NPC","Of course! It's just bad luck that you got everything."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew15_Aristocrat_Default","Can we talk?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew16_Drew_NPC","Talk to my lawyer. Oh, wait…"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew17_Violent_Default","He needs a smack in the mouth."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew18_Aristocrat_Default","He's… grieving."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew19_Violent_Default","I'll give him something to grieve over."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria11_Aristocrat_Default","Lyria, I'm so very sorry for your loss."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria12_Lyria_NPC","Oh - you're the… well… I knew she liked you, but…"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria13_Aristocrat_Default","Frankly, this all seems like a prank."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria14_Lyria_NPC","Right? That's what I told the notary."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria15_Lyria_NPC","Goodbye."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria16_Lowlife_Default","These people!"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria11_Aristocrat_Default","Adria! How are you?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria12_Adria_NPC","Well, sad, of course. You?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria13_Aristocrat_Default","Thanks for asking. A bit down, of course."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria14_Aristocrat_Default","She taught me so much."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria15_Adria_NPC","I know. She was proud of you."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria16_Aristocrat_Default","Thank you. "
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria17_Aristocrat_Default","Listen - this will. It bothers me…"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria18_Aristocrat_Default","…I really don't want to quarrel with you and your siblings."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria19_Adria_NPC","I'm afraid you won't have a choice."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria110_Adria_NPC","Lyria is a lying bitch, and Drew is a tactless jerk."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria111_Aristocrat_Default","What would you do with the inheritance?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria112_Adria_NPC","Me? Share it with the two other sharks, just to stay alive."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria113_Aristocrat_Default","Fair enough."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack1_Anyother_Default","They're not bandits."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack2_Aristocrat_Default","No. More like hired assassins."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack3_Anyother_Default","You know what this means."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack4_Aristocrat_Default","Stay alert. The notary's mansion might not be safe either."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending1_Cynical_Default","Oh, look - they're all here."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending2_Lyria_NPC","So you left Caer Cyflen without a word. "
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending3_Drew_NPC","How rude."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending4_Aristocrat_Default","Can we take this inside?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending5_Lyria_NPC","Just tell us what you decided and stop wasting our time."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending6_Lyria_NPC","At least share the inheritance. I need it for my research."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending7_Lyria_Default","The Circle of Danantar will reward you."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending8_Drew_NPC","Yeah, right. That inheritance will give me enough to get married…"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending9_Drew_Default","My father-in-law to be is very influential in the Tower of Knowledge, you know."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending10_Aristocrat_Default","Adria?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending11_Adria_NPC","I respect Mother's decision. It's all yours."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending12_Drew_NPC","What? Did the Soraks replace you or something?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending13_Lyria_NPC","Even from you, Drew, that's low."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending14_Notary_NPC","Ah, so you are all here."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending15_Notary_NPC","Why didn't you come in?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending16_Aristocrat_Default","You're right. Let's finish this."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending17_WRITTEN_ChoiceA","The inheritance is mine."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending18_WRITTEN_ChoiceB","<i>Choose an heir from among the children.</i>"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending19_WRITTEN_ChoiceC","<i>Split the inheritance four ways.</i>"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending20_WRITTEN_ChoiceD","<i>Split the inheritance between the children.</i>"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending21_Aristocrat_ChoiceA","Your mother left me everything. Her will should be respected."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending22_Aristocrat_ChoiceC","We'll split the inheritance between the four of us."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending23_Aristocrat_ChoiceD","You should each get a third of the inheritance."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending24_WRITTEN_ChoiceE","<i>Give the inheritance to Lyria.</i>"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending25_WRITTEN_ChoiceF","<i>Give the inheritance to Drew.</i>"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending26_WRITTEN_ChoiceG","<i>Give the inheritance to Adria.</i>"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending27_Aristocrat_ChoiceE","I'll give Lyria the inheritance."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending28_Aristocrat_ChoiceF","I'll give Drew the inheritance."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending29_Aristocrat_ChoiceG","I'll give Adria the inheritance."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending30_Lyria_NPC","Excellent!"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending31_Drew_NPC","By all the gods…"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending32_Drew_NPC","Yes!"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending33_Lyria_NPC","What? Why?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending34_Adria_NPC","Thank you! I'll share with you both, you know it."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending35_Notary_NPC","Well, that's settled, then."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending36_Notary_NPC","I will magically seal the will."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending37_Notary_NPC","I'm sorry, the law forbids it."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending38_Notary_NPC","You can share it after you accept it, but there must be one single heir."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending39_Notary_NPC","You know… paperwork."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending40_Adria_NPC","Fine… I thought I had cracked you…"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending41_Aristocrat_Default","What?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending42_Adria_Default","Sorry, sir, this will have to be done outside the law, I'm afraid."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending43_Anyother_Default","She killed all her siblings?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending44_Cynical_Default","Maybe she was a Sorak agent?"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending45_Aristocrat_Default","They were all my childhood friends…"
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending46_Cynical_Default","Oh, yes. Sorry."
"Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending47_Aristocrat_Default","It's over. Let's go."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_01_Default_Default","Who's this? Seems to like wolves."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_02_Insight_10_Success","Could be a ranger. Could be a werewolf. Could be something else."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_03_Kill-CHOICE","Let's kill them!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_04_Leave_CHOICE","Let's get out of here!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_05_Speak_CHOICE","Let's talk to him."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_06_Kill_Default","Just someone else to kill. No one out here is friendly, remember?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_07_Friendly_Default","Maybe he knows something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_08_Pragmatic_Default","Out here, there's no such thing as ""can't hurt."" "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_09_Pragmatic_Default","Didn't your mother tell you never to talk to strangers?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_10_Leave_Default","We're not here to make friends, and we have enough enemies. Let's just go!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_11_Speak_Default","He might know something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_12_Persuade_CHOICE","Hello!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_13_Intimidate_CHOICE","Get over here!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_14_Friendly_Default","Hello! We come in peace! Can we talk to you?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_15_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success","Talk, then. And stay where you are. I can hear you well enough from here."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_16_Persuade_Default_20_Success","We're… interested in the castle. Can you tell us anything about it?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_17_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success","Not much. What do you want to know?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_18_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure","You come in peace, do you? Then you're the only peaceful things here."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_19_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure","Go in peace, before I get tired of being peaceful."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_20_Intimidate_Default","Hey, you! Get over here!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_21_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success","I can hear you fine from here. What do you want?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_22_Intimidate_Default_20_Success","What do you know about that castle over there?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_23_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success","What do you want to know?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_24_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure","Ha! Aren't you tough?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_25_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure","Believe me, you don't want me coming over there."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_26_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure","Now get lost, before I change my mind!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_27_Default_CHOICE","Who lives there?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_28_Fighter_CHOICE","How strong is the garrison?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_29_Authority_CHOICE","Who is its ruler?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_30_Default_Default","Who lives there? What can you tell us about them?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_31_Talbut_NPC","I deal with the guard captain. Name's Adam the Twelfth. Undead now."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_32_Talbut_NPC","He lets us hunt here and we tell him who comes and goes."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_33_Default_Default","Sounds like a good arrangement. So you've never been inside the castle?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_34_Talbut_NPC","No."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_35_Default_Default","And there's no one else outside the castle?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_36_Default_Default","Just a ghost - a dwarf. Doesn't seem dangerous."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_37_Fighter_Default","What's the garrison like? Strong? Weak? Monsters?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_38_Talbut_NPC","The captain's a wraith, or something similar. The guard's mostly skeletons."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_39_Fighter_Default","Mostly?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_40_Talbut_NPC","That's what I've seen from outside. Never been inside."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_41_Authority_Default","Who rules the castle? Or should I rather ask what?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_42_Talbut_NPC","Name's Mardracht. Probably undead, but I never met him."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_43_Authority_Default","Probably undead? Why do you say that?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_44_Talbut_NPC","Undead or a necromancer, is my guess. Everyone I've seen there is undead."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_45_WRITTEN_Exit","Thanks, that's all."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_45_Goodbye_Default","Many thanks for the information, uh - I didn't catch your name?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_46_Talbut_NPC","Talbut."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_01_Starter_Normal","Look! What's that?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_02_Partner_Normal","Some kind of incorporeal being - undead, most likely."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_03_Starter_Normal","Look! That must be the dwarf ghost we heard about!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_04_Kill-CHOICE","Let's destroy it!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_05_Leave_CHOICE","Let's keep moving."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_06_Speak_CHOICE","Let's talk to him."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_07_Kill_Default","The undead are an affront to nature! They must be destroyed!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_08_Leave_Default","An unnecessary fight is an unnecessary risk. Let's move on."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_09_Speak_Default","I'll take information where I can get it - even from a ghost."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_10_Persuade_CHOICE","We have questions."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_11_Intimidate_CHOICE","Get over here!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_12_Starter_Normal","Hello! Could we ask you some questions?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_13_Starter_Normal","Hello! Are you the Antiquarian we've heard about?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_14_Angbi_NPC","Hello! I am Angbi Kramsson, of the Guild of Antiquarians. Or at least, I used to be."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_15_Intimidate","Hey, you - ghost! Get over here!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_15_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success","All right. There's no need to be rude. What do you want?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_16_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure","What are you going to do - kill me? Just - leave me alone."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_17_Starter_Default","What can you tell us about the castle? Who lives there?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_18_Angbi_NPC","Two women. A high elf, but living, and quite old. She is a necromancer of some sort."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_19_Starter_Default","And the other?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_20_Angbi_NPC","Once human, but definitely undead now. A Defiler, I think…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_21_Angbi_NPC","…and she had a gang of ghouls with her. Horrid beasts. I avoided them."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_22_Starter_Default","Is there anyone else?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_23_Angbi_NPC","There's a garrison - skeletons, mostly. I avoided them, too."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_01_NPC_Angbi","Actually, I was hoping to ask you a greater favor."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_02_Starter_Default","How can we help you?"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_03_NPC_Angbi","I was killed in this cemetery. My bones are here somewhere."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_04_Partner_Default","And you'd like us to take them home for burial, so you can find peace."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_05_NPC_Angbi","Well, yes - but they got a little scattered. The wolves, you see."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_06_Joker_Normal","Now, that's just rude. "
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_07_NPC_Angbi","As far as I can… feel, they are in three separate places."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_08_Joker_Normal","Well, that's just you all over!"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_09_Helpful_Normal","You can rely on us."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_10_NPC_Angbi","It's not just about burial, although of course I'd be grateful for that, too."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_11_NPC_Angbi","Since I was killed, I've carried on studying this necropolis…"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_12_NPC_Angbi","…but I can't touch material things, including pens - so I haven't been able to update my journal."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_13_Joker_Normal","Now, that's what I call work ethic."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_14_NPC_Angbi","And since my spirit is bound to my mortal remains…"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_15_NPC_Angbi","…I can't return to Caer Cyflen to report in person."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_16_NPC_Angbi","But if you take my bones back, perhaps my spirit could travel with them…"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_17_NPC_Angbi","…and the knowledge I've recovered won't be lost."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Helpful_Formal","We will do as you ask, Angbi Kramsson of the Antiquarians!"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_01_Starter_Default","Delegate Summer! May we speak with you?"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_02_NPC_Halman","Yes - what is it?"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_03_Starter_Default","We have something for you. "
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_04_NPC_Angbi","Or rather, someONE."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_05_NPC_Halman","Angbi? Angbi Kramsson? Is that you?"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_06_NPC_Angbi","It is. Or was. Anyway, I'm here."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_07_NPC_Angbi","These kind deputies brought my bones back, and my spirit came with them."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_08_NPC_Halman","Thank you, deputies. I am in your debt, and so is the Guild of Antiquarians. "
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_09_NPC_Halman","On behalf of the Guild, let me offer you something for your trouble."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_10_NPC_Halman","I will make sure you go home to your family for burial, Angbi."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_11_NPC_Angbi","Thank you, Halman. But before you do, I'd like to make my report."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_12_NPC_Halman","Your report?"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_13_NPC_Angbi","One advantage of being a ghost is the ability to walk through walls, you see…"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_14_NPC_Angbi","…so after my death, I was able to conduct a very thorough survey of an Imperial necropolis."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_15_NPC_Angbi","I couldn't lift a pen to write it down, so I'll report in person. If that's acceptable."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_16_NPC_Halman","Well… I… let me take you to the Chancellor. She will want to know."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_17_NPC_Angbi","Capital! We're distant cousins, you know."
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_18_NPC_Halman","No, I didn't."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_01_Caerellian_NPC","You there! Stop! Don't move!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_02_Caerellian_NPC","Who are you?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_03_LEAVE_CHOICE","We should leave."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_04_KILL_CHOICE","We should attack."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_05_PERSUADE_CHOICE","We should negotiate."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_06_DECEIVE_CHOICE","We should trick him."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_07_Leave_Default","He's not the listening type, I can tell. We should leave and try another approach."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_08_Kill_Default","It's just a few skeletons. Let's get 'em!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_09_Deceive_Default","Look, I can tell you're a very important and, ah…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_10_Persuade_Default","Will you at least hear us before we go?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_11_Deceiver_Normal","…long-serving officer, so I won't waste your time…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_12_Deceiver_Normal","…the fact is, I'm with the Imperial intelligence service. "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_13_Deceiver_Normal","The others don't know, but our mission has been ordered by the Emperor himself."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_14_Deceiver_Normal","Our orders are to meet with your master and ask him certain questions. Nothing more than that."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_15_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Success","It's not up to me. You'll have to deal with the others in the keep."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure","I may be dead, but I'm not stupid."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure2","The Empire fell a thousand years ago. There is no Emperor."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_17_Caerellian_NPC","Take your lies and get out!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_18_Persuader_Normal","We understand that your master values his privacy, and we respect that."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_19_Starter_Normal","You may not have heard of the Legacy Council, but…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_20_Caerellian_NPC","I know the name. That dwarf - Antiquarian, or whatever he calls himself - they sent him too."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_21_Caerellian_NPC","I'll tell you what I told him: your Council has no authority here, and the master does not receive visitors!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_22_Caerellian_NPC","I don't know how you got in, but either you leave peacefully, or…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_23_Persuader_Normal","We know that your master is very learned and powerful. We just want to ask him about something, that's all."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_25_Caerellian_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure","You want to steal from him, more like!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_26_Persuader_Normal","No - I swear…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_01_Lizzaria_NPC","Who are you? What do you want?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_02_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE","Ask for mercy."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_03_KILL_CHOICE","To destroy you."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_04_PERSUADE_CHOICE","To meet your master."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_05_DECEIVE_CHOICE","To make a deal."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_06_Intimidate_Default","Give me one good reason why we shouldn't kill you right here."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_07_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success","Tell me what you want, and I'll think about it."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_08_Intimidator_Normal","What we want?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_09_Lizzaria_NPC","I know this place. You don't. Let's trade."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_10_Intimidator_Normal","All right - talk."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_11_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure","Who do you think you're dealing with? "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC","That tough act may impress the girls back home…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC2","…but I've seen scarier things in the mirror."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_18_Kill_Default","You can never trust a necromancer. We should just kill them all."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_19_Persuader_Normal","We need to consult your master about an ancient magical artifact."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_20_Persuader_Normal","All we need is to talk to him, and then we'll be on our way and you'll never see us again."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success","I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2","There are some things you should know."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_22_Persuader_Normal","What things?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_23_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Falure","You must think I'm a complete idiot."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_24_Lizzaria_NPC","Kill them all!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_25_Deceiver_Normal","Look, whatever you do in the privacy of your own castle is your own business…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_26_Deceiver_Normal","…as long as you don't do it to us, of course."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal","But the thing is, we've come a very long way…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal2","…and it's vitally important that we speak to Master Mardracht."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_28_Lizzaria_NPC","Really?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_29_Deceiver_Normal","Oh, yes - it's a matter of life and - well, you know what I mean."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_30_Lizzaria_NPC","What's it about?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal","Ah - I'm sorry. Really. But our orders are to speak only to him."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal2","They come from the very highest level."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC","I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC2","There are some things you should know."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC","Well, in that case, go straight upstairs and ask for Aksha."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC2","If anyone can persuade the master, she can."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_35_Lizzaria_NPC","If you want to talk to Mardracht, you'll have to get past Aksha. "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_36_Starter_Normal","Who's Aksha?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37_Lizzaria_NPC","A defiler. She lives upstairs. "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_38_Lizzaria_NPC","She turned up a few years ago, seemed interested in the work, offered to help out…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_39_Lizzaria_NPC","…and suddenly she'd installed herself upstairs and no one talked to the master except through her. "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_40_Lizzaria_NPC","I haven't seen Mardracht face to face since she got here. "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC","She says she takes messages to him, and she brings messages back…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC2","…but they don't sound like him."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC","I know - knew him."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC2","He was my mentor, my teacher."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC3","She's holding him prisoner, I'm certain."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_43_Starter_Normal","So we'll have to go through her? "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC","If you can. She's got a pack of ghouls…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC2","…and those defiler powers of hers are no joke, either."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC","We've tried using force before, more than once…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC2","…but I got sick of losing people. "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal","Thanks for the warning."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal2","Now, suppose we do manage to reach Master Mardracht…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_47_Starter_Normal","…what's the best way to approach him? "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC","Hard to say."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC2","The Cataclysm hit him hard…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC3","…and then Aksha - who knows what she's done to him? "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_49_Lizzaria_NPC","The stairs will take you to her apartments. Good luck getting past her. "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_01_Aksha_NPC","Well. Lizzaria's taste in minions seems to be improving."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_02_Starter","We're no one's minions, lady."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_03_Aksha_NPC","You defeated her, then? I'm almost impressed."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_04_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE","Step away!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_05_KILL_CHOICE","We'll destroy you!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_06_PERSUADE_CHOICE","We just want to talk to Mardracht."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_07_DECEIVE_CHOICE","We can offer you blood."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate_Defult","We need to speak to your master."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate2_Defult","You can get out of our way or try to stop us."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_09_Deceive_Default","Let's trade. If you help us, we can help you."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default","We ask a simple boon:"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default2","An audience with Master Mardracht, and safe passage out of the castle."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11_Kill_Default","We'll leave an impression on you, too - a deep and bloody one!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_12_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success","I'm in a generous mood today. Go ahead - but don't expect to get any sense out of the old coward."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_13_Default_Default","What does that mean - getting sense out of him?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_14_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure","Kill them! Kill them all!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_15_Aksha_NPC","Trade? What do you have that I could possibly want?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal","(low voice) How about blood?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal2","Not mine, of course…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal3","…but get me in to see Mardracht and the others are all yours."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_17_Aksha_NPC","You'd sell the lives of your companions to see one crazy old wizard?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_18_Deceiver_Normal","Crazy? What do you mean?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_19_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure","You must think I was born yesterday…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal","We believe your master knows about a powerful ancient artifact."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal2","We need his knowledge."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_21_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success","Hm. Your puny minds couldn't comprehend what he once knew."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_22_Aksha_NPC","Now, it's a good day if he knows who I am."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_23_Persuader_Normal","What do you mean?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_24_Aksha_NPC","You'll see."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_25_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure","Let me think…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC","He's sealed his apartments off with powerful magic."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC2","Keeps raving about gods coming to get him."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_27_Aksha_NPC","The Minor Gate is the only way in."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_28_Default_Default","Minor Gate?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_29_Aksha_NPC","Yes. Over there."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_01_Mardracht_NPC","Who are you? How did you get in here?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_02_Default_Default","Master Mardracht?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_03_Mardracht_NPC","You know my name! How do you know my name?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_04_Default_Default","We represent the Legacy Council, Master - and we mean you no harm."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_05_Mardracht_NPC","No harm? No harm, they say - they always say that, always. They lie!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_06_Mardracht_NPC","Get out! I can still defend myself, you know!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_07_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE","Can't you see we're too strong?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_08_PERSUADE_CHOICE","We don't want to kill you."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_09_DECEIVE_CHOICE","We want to save Solasta."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default","We found you and we breached your defenses."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default2","Do you really want to test your power against ours?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default","You are right to fear us, and those who sent us."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default2","We are powerful - but you don't have to die."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default","All we ask is that you hear what we have to say."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default2","After that, we'll leave you in peace if that's what you want."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_13_Mardracht_NP","If you are not here to kill me - then what?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal","I offer you the chance to buy your life."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal2","Will you take it? Will you give up your gem?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_15_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Success","For my life? I… "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_16_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Failure","Lies! All lies! I know your gods and their treachery!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_17_Deceive_Default","The gods have commanded us to kill you…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_18_Mardracht_NPC","I knew it!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_19_Deceiver_Normal","…but we don't need to do that - if you'll help us."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_20_Deceiver_Normal","We must have the Gem of Necromancy."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_21_Mardracht_NPC","The gem… ? But…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal","But without your gem, we can't remake the Crown."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal2","Without the Crown, we can't defeat the gods."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_23_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Success","I… The gods? I don't… the Crown?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_24_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Failure","You have the Crown? No!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC","I see through your lies! Your evil gods want its power to destroy me!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC2","To destroy Solasta!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default","We are here to ask about the Crown of the Magister…"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default2","…specifically, about the Gem of Necromancy."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_27_Mardracht_NPC","What? What do you know of the Crown? What are you plotting?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_28_Persuader_Normal","We're not plotting anything. We don't really know what's going on."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_29_Persuader_Normal","But the Crown found us, and it seems that it wants to be whole again."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success","But wait - the Crown is active?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2","And it chose you?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_31_Persuader_Normal","Well… Yes. We're not sure why."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_32_Mardracht_NPC","The very existence of Solasta must be threatened!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure","Give me the Crown!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure2","This is no task for the likes of you!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_34_Mardracht_NPC","I must find the other Masters! Give me the Crown!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_35_Persuader_Normal","But…?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_36_Mardracht_NPC","NOW!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_37_Mardracht_NPC","This is what you came for."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_38_Mardracht_NPC","Take it - and leave me alone!"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle1_Any_Default","The gem's in the castle?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle2_Any_Default","Maybe. It's in that direction."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle3_Any_Default","That's a good-sized castle. A garrison of two dozen at least."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle4_Any_Default","There's a path to the right. Maybe we can find cover, and size the place up without being seen."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle5_Any_Default","We could just show our Legacy Council credentials."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle6_Any_Default","Assuming they're law-abiding folk who'll respect the Council… "
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle7_Any_Default","…Not too many of those around here, I'm guessing."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate1_Any_Default","We're not getting in that way."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate2_Any_Default","Could we climb up?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate3_Any_Default","It's too open. We'd be easy targets."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate4_Any_Default","We'll have to find another way."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs1_Any_Default","Remember the way we've come. I wouldn't want to get lost down here."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs2_Any_Default","Typical First Expansion architecture, with some embellishments…"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs3_Any_Default","…probably used right up to the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs4_Any_Default","Great idea! Let's walk through the catacombs, talking loudly!"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs5_Any_Default","Everyone knows the undead are deaf!"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry1_Any_Default","Another door."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry2_Any_Default","Oh, good. Just when I was thinking it would be too easy."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry3_Any_Default","Look at the top. What is that?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry4_Any_Default","Looks like a magical shield of some sort."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry5_Any_Default","Some sort? How many sorts are there?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry6_Any_Default","What we're looking for is up there."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry7_Any_Default","You're sure?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry8_Any_Default","It's obvious - the best loot gets the best protection."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well1_Any_Default","This could be our way in."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well2_Any_Default","Perfect. We climb down a wet, slippery, stone shaft…"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well3_Any_Default","…into water that's who knows how deep…"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well4_Any_Default","…and hope there's a way out. What could possibly go wrong?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain1_Any_Default","This drain could be a way in."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain2_Any_Default","Into what? The bathroom's one way, and the cesspool the other?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain3_Any_Default","Suppose we get down there and it's just six-inch pipes?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain4_Any_Default","Then we'll look for another way in. But let's try it first!"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside1_Any_Default","That doesn't look right."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside2_Any_Default","It's a drain. What's wrong with that?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside3_Any_Default","Yes, but inside a building?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside4_Any_Default","Maybe the roof leaks."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside5_Any_Default","Maybe this was a stock shed. A drain can be handy for mucking out."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside6_Any_Default","That one's big enough for a cow to fall down. Doesn't make sense."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside7_Any_Default","Unless…"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside8_Any_Default","I swear, if you say something smart…"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside9_Any_Default","I never say anything that's not. But think about it:"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside10_Any_Default","It's big enough to climb down. It's hidden in a building. And it's close to both the walls and the keep."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside11_Any_Default","Are you saying it's a secret entrance?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs1_Any_Default","The outside graves were likely for servants and guards."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs2_Any_Default","The mausoleum holds a few burials, but its main purpose is to hide this secret entrance."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs3_Any_Default","The most important graves are in the catacombs down below."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs4_Any_Default","And by ""important,"" you mean ""rich."""
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter1_Any_Default","So - this is a Minor Gate?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter2_Any_Default","And we're sure it goes where the defiler woman said it goes?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter3_Any_Default","Did you see any other way to get there?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter4_Any_Default","So we're just going to trust her?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter5_Any_Default","That looks like a Minor Gate."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter6_Any_Default","Where do you suppose it goes?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter7_Any_Default","To the Master's floor, hopefully."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter8_Any_Default","Or into the heart of a volcano or somewhere equally unpleasant."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter9_Any_Default","We've heard how paranoid this Master is."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter10_Any_Default","So - are we going?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter11_Any_Default","Why don't you go first? If it's somewhere nice, you can come back and tell us."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd1_Any_Default","So that's it?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd2_Any_Default","Yes? I can feel its power. It's… incredible!"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd3_Any_Default","Don't let it overwhelm you. Necromancy is dark magic."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd4_Any_Default","That's right. We should probably sell it. How much do you think a smallish palace costs these days?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd5_Any_Default","Stop it. You know we can't do that."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd6_Any_Default","We must get it back to the Council."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd7_Any_Default","Can't blame me for trying."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar1_Any_Default","Ugh. Teleporting feels weird."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar2_Any_Default","I wonder what this Mardracht is like?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar3_Any_Default","If he fought at the Rift, imagine the stories he has to tell!"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar4_Any_Default","Dropping in unannounced on a paranoid recluse with untold magical powers. What could possibly go wrong?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones011_Any_Default","It's a book!"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones012_Any_Default","You're amazing! Just one look, and you knew!"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones013_Any_Default","That's the sigil of the Antiquarians on the cover!"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones014_Any_Default","It's in the common tongue: ""The Journal of Angbi Kramsson."""
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones015_Any_Default","Those must be his bones here."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones016_Any_Default","I bet the Antiquarians would like to have this."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones017_Any_Default","That was the ghost we met earlier! "
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText011_Any_Default","What's this?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText012_Any_Default","Going out on a limb, here - but I *think* it's a piece of parchment."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText013_Any_Default","You're not as funny as you think you are."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText014_Any_Default","It's high elven. Looks like notes for some kind of experiment."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText015_Any_Default","Like, for example, doing unspeakable magical things to dead bodies?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText021_Any_Default","What's this? "
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText022_Any_Default","It's a journal. Look - dates here, and entries there."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText023_Any_Default","What language is this?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText024_Any_Default","Draconic. They say it's older than high elven."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText025_Any_Default","Hm. Some scholars use obscure languages to prevent others stealing their research."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText026_Any_Default","Well, everyone said he was paranoid."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText027_Any_Default","Or… "
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText028_Any_Default","What? He's a dragon? How would that work?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText029_Any_Default","The most powerful dragons can take any form they choose. Why not an elf?"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText0210_Any_Default","That's pretty far-fetched. He probably just learned draconic."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil1_Any_Default","That looks weird."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil2_Any_Default","It's similar to some magical wards I've seen, but…"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil3_Any_Default","Don't touch it! Don't go near it! Don't even look at it!"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil4_Any_Default","It hasn't done anything yet."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil5_Any_Default","It doesn't work? I wonder…"
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil6_Any_Default","Don't. Just don't."
"Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil7_Any_Default","Perhaps he made a *spelling* mistake!"

"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_14Galar_NPC","No, wounded! Deep wounds…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_15Galar_NPC","…ripped open, as if by sharp claws."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_16Galar_NPC","We found him near the road. It looked like he had crawled there."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_17_LawkeeperorElse_Default","Claw wounds? And no healing could help him? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_18Galar_NPC","That's right. The wounds were oozing."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_19Galar_NPC","It's a wonder he was still alive."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_20_Choice3Spy_WRITTEN","Send word? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_21_Choice3Spy_Spoken","Why send word?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_22Galar_NPC","Because this man was a corporal in the Coparann Watch. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_23_Starter_Default","You want us to take word of his death to Coparann."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_24Galar_NPC","Yes - take this note and his personal effects to Sergeant Nikannen."

"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_11_AcademicChoice2_WRITTEN","We have something for you."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_12_AcademicChoice2_Default","We were asked to give you certain items! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_13_SgtNikannen_NPC","Asked? By whom?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_14_SgtNikannen_NPC","And what items?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_15_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN","Galar sent us."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_16_SpyOrElse_Default","Master Galar Goldentongue asked us to see you - and to bring these…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_17_SellswordOrElse_Slang","Here they are, Sarge!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_18_SgtNikannen_NPC","The ring, the badge, the insignia…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_19_SgtNikannen_NPC","The man who wore those was of middling height…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_20_SgtNikannen_NPC","…broad shoulders, dark hair, and a broken nose. Am I right?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_21_SpyorElse_Default","Correct! You knew him, then?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_22_SgtNikannen_NPC","He broke his nose after an… exchange of views behind the barracks."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_23_SgtNikannen_NPC","Roald tried to headbutt his basic training instructor. That was me!"

"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_27_DiplomatOrElse_Default","Two days ago."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_28_SpyOrElse_Default","It was at a small camp in some Manacalon ruins. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_29_SpyOrElse_Default","He was found almost dead by the caravan people."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_30_SpyOrElse_Default","They tried to heal him and then…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_31_SpyOrElse_Default","…some travelers in the caravan rushed in…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_32_SpyOrElse_Default","…to kill your friend and the guards Master Galar had posted!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_33_SgtNikannen_NPC","And no idea who those guys were? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_34_SellswordOrElse_Default","No, Sarge. They looked like common mercs to me! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_35_SgtNikannen_Default","Did Roald say anything to you? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_37_SgtNikannen_NPC","Dire news. Listen - go and speak to the Ceannard. Tell him everything…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_SgtNikannen_NPC","…but leave Gromnir out of it for now."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_AcademicOrElse_WRITTEN","The Ceannard?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AcademicOrElse_Spoken","The Ceannard?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AristocratOrElse_WRITTEN","Not the Baron?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_40_AristocratOrElse_Spoken","And why not the Baron?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_41_SgtNikannen_NPC","The Ceannard is the ruler of the Vale of Coparann."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_42_SgtNikannen_NPC","Talk to the Ceannard first and then…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_43_SgtNikannen_NPC","…perhaps we can discuss some more!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_44_AcademicOrElse_Default","And where is the Ceannard? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_45_Kythaela_NPC","But we need to talk to the Baron!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_46_SgtNikannen_NPC","You can find him at the Town Hall at this hour."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_47_SgtNikannen_NPC","Give him this note from me and tell him exactly what happened."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_48_SgtNikannen_NPC","You won't talk to him without my leave…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_49_SgtNikannen_NPC","Talk to the Ceannard first and then…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_50_SgtNikannen_NPC","Here - my signature on the letter from Galar…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_51_SgtNikannen_NPC","Take it to Master Warmhearth at the general store."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_52_SgtNikannen_NPC","And here's a note for the Ceannard!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_53_Any_Default","Stay in the light!"

"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_3_Any_Default","Well, it all began when we came upon this caravan…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_4_Ceannard_NPC","Go on."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_5_Ceannard_NPC","Hmm… military matters I usually leave in the more than competent hands of the Baron…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_6_Ceannard_NPC","…but Nikannen sent you to me."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_7_Ceannard_NPC","You see, he is a rarity in the Stonefist Mercenary company…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_8_Ceannard_NPC","…the one old hand who was born here. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_9_Ceannard_NPC","We have known each other almost all our lives!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_10_Ceannard_NPC","He is the reason Stonefist came to our aid during the orc invasion."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_11_Ceannard_NPC","And he sent you to me? That's odd! Why did you come to Coparann? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_12_Sellsword_WRITTEN","The Stonefist company? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_13_Sellsword_Spoken","The Stonefist mercenary company? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_14_Ceannard_NPC","Our military force, since they helped us repel the orc invasion!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_15_Academic_WRITTEN","Orc invasion? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_16_Academic_Spoken","An orc invasion? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_17_Ceannard_NPC","Happened about fifteen years ago. Several tribes got together…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_18_Ceannard_NPC","…whipped into a frenzy by a shaman."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_19_Ceannard_NPC","They hit us hard and opened a breach…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_20_Ceannard_NPC","…got a foothold in the outer works, and were about to hit the town. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_21_Ceannard_NPC","Then Gromnir hit them from behind, and they were between hammer and anvil!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_22_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN","Stonefist?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_23_SpyOrElse_Spoken","Who's Stonefist?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_24_Ceannard_NPC","Gromnir Stonefist, founder of the Stonefist mercenary company!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_Exit_WRITTEN","That doesn't answer my question."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_26_Highclass_Spoken","We are agents of the Legacy Council."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_27_Highclass_Default","Our current mission is to escort Lady Kythaela."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_28_Highclass_Default","Coparann was the seat of her family before the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_29_Ceannard_NPC","And Lady Kythaela is on a nostalgia trip? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_30_Highclass_Default","Far from it! One of her ancestors left family heirlooms hidden in the fortress. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_31_Highclass_Default","Among those heirlooms, we hope to find clues about the next stage of our quest!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_32_Ceannard_NPC","Old elven nobility! I am sure I have never seen you before, Lady Kythaela. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_33_Ceannard_NPC","So tell me something about Coparann that a newcomer or even a casual visitor couldn't know."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_34_Kythaela_NPC","In a side valley, there is an Imperial mausoleum of Lanaerach, home of the honored dead!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_35_AcademicorElse_WRITTEN","Mausoleum?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_36_AcademicorElse_Spoken","A place of remembrance?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_37_Kythaela_NPC","Yes, for the honored dead who fell in battle for the Empire. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_38_Ceannard_NPC","There is indeed an ancient Imperial mausoleum in a side valley, sealed off since the Fall of Manacalon!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_39_Ceannard_NPC","Not many know of it. Thank you, my lady - I am convinced."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_40_Sellsword_WRITTEN","Lanaerach?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_41_Sellsword_Spoken","What's Lanaerach?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_42_Ceannard_NPC","A very particular kind of marble - very precious! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_43_Ceannard_NPC","The traditional stone for the honored dead!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_44_Ceannard_NPC","As for the rest of you, you said you were sent by the Legacy Council."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_45_Ceannard_NPC","We see a lot of Council agents on their way to the Badlands, and they bring a lot of rumors."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_46_Ceannard_NPC","So tell me - is there any truth to the rumor that the Soraks are back?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_47_AcademicorElse_Default","Yes! And they are as nasty as legends made them! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_48_Ceannard_NPC","Can they truly possess others?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_49_AcademicorElse_Default","Not possess, exactly…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_50_AcademicorElse_Default","…what they do is worse…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_51_AcademicorElse_Default","…if you believe the tales that the paladins of Einar recovered from their archives. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_52_Ceannard_NPC","Do me a favor: walk around our city, talk to the people…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_53_Ceannard_NPC","…then report your impressions to Sergeant Nikannen."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_54_Ceannard_NPC","Not a word about what you told me, though."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_55_Insight15Success_Default","Do you believe the Soraks are in Coparann?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_56_Ceannard_NPC","I'll say no more for the time being!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_57_Ceannard_NPC","Walk the streets, then see Nikannen! Meanwhile, stay in the light! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_58_Crownbearer_Default","Clear skies to you, Ceannard! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_1_Merchant1_NPC","It's rather silly, really. This young man…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_2_Merchant1_NPC","…he asked me for a specific design so he could propose…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_3_Merchant2_NPC","So? He probably gambled the money away!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_4_Merchant1_NPC","Not him! Straight arrow on the fast track to sergeant or higher! I asked around!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_5_Merchant2_NPC","So? Where is this paragon of yours?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_6_Merchant1_NPC","Consigned to guard duty! A whole week! And that just on his return from patrol! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_1_YoungMaid_NPC","Sergeant, when can I see my Erik? He is due some liberty!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_2_Sergeant_NPC","Gal, I already told ya! He's assigned to guard duty!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_3_YoungMaid_NPC","A whole week of it - and that after two weeks on patrol! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_4_YoungMaid_NPC","No - he just doesn't want to see me anymore."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_5_Sergeant_NPC","Now, gal, don't you fret! It's not that at all."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_6_Sergeant_NPC","The Old Man has had his whole patrol on guard duty in the basement ever since they came back! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_7_Sergeant_NPC","Something's up - and whatever it is, it can't be good!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_1_Bartender_NPC","Mistress Mildred! The brewer wants to know when to bring the next delivery of ale. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_2_Bartender_NPC","He doesn't want it to go stale - he has his reputation to consider!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_3_Mildred_NPC","If only Stonefist had let his thirsty patrol out on leave as usual…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_4_Mildred_NPC","…but now, we've only the regulars and the ale's not moving too fast!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_5_Mildred_NPC","Take him two empty barrels and get two new ones. It's the best we can do right now!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_1_Patron1_NPC","Oh, the Ceannard's hopping mad!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_2_Patron2_NPC","Why's that?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_3_Patron1_NPC","A whole week he's been waiting - and still no meeting with the Baron!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_4_Patron2_NPC","That's weird. Usually they meet every day, at least!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_5_Patron2_NPC","Like an old couple, the two of them!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_1_Wilf_NPC","Well met! What can we do for you on this fine morning?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_2_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","We have a letter for you."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_3_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","The Ceannard sent us."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","Let's see your wares."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceD_WRITTEN","We should go."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_5_ChoiceA_Spoken","Clear skies to you! Master Goldentongue sent this letter!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_6_Wilf_NPC","Of course, of course!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_7_Wilf_NPC","Yes - Master Goldentongue's instructions are quite clear!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_8_Wilf_NPC","Here is your money - and here's a receipt to sign!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_9_Wilf_NPC","Would you be interested in sampling our wares?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_10_Any_Default","What do you sell?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_11_Wilf_NPC","A pleasure doing business with you! Stay in the light! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_12_Any_Normal","The Ceannard sent us to talk to you."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_13_Any_Normal","Anything unusual in recent days?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_14_Wilf_NPC","The Baron came back with a bunch of prisoners. Highwaymen, apparently."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_15_Wilf_NPC","I'm wondering why they didn't hang them on the spot!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_16_Any_Normal","Hanging, eh? Would that be the normal practice?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_17_Wilf_NPC","Yes. You don't need that many prisoners to make them talk, if you ask me!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Well met again!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC","So - you've had a chance to walk around the city and hear what people are saying?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC","What do you think?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_4_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","The soldiers."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_5_SellswordOrElse_Normal","Something is wrong. Soldiers back from a patrol denied leave…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_6_SellswordOrElse_Normal","…posted to guard duty instead of visiting the tavern."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","These highwaymen."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_8_ChoiceB_Spoken","The story with the highwaymen is also weird. Why keep them prisoner?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal","Normally the penalty is clear and swift. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_10_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal","On the frontier, you don't feed idle people, particularly not scum like highwaymen."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_11_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal","At best, you put them to work. At worst, they become fertilizer!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_Temp","So what do you think?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC","There are two things I didn't mention in our last conversation."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Things about Roald and the Baron."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_14_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","Roald?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_15_ChoiceA_Spoken","What about Roald?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_16_SergeantNikannen_NPC","When you told me of Roald's death and returned his personal effects…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC","…I was speechless, not out of grief but…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC","…because, not a week before, Roald had come back from patrol! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_19_Any_Default","You mean… one of them is… not who he seems."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_20_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","The Baron?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_21_ChoiceB_Spoken","What about the Baron?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_22_SergeantNikannen_NPC","I have known him for twenty years. I was a founding member of the company."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_23_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Now, for the first time in ten years, I am officer of the day, posted here."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_24_SergeantNikannen_NPC","And that's not all…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_25_SergeantNikannen_NPC","For the last ten years he's always called me Joris. Now, all of a sudden it's back to Nikannen. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_26_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Something is wrong. I can feel it. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_27_SellswordOrElse_Normal","Suggestions, Sarge? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC","The Ceannard mentioned your mission. He and I go way back. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_29_SergeantNikannen_NPC","So - go see the baron and tell him your heirloom story."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_30_SergeantNikannen_NPC","I know what his normal reaction would be…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_31_SergeantNikannen_NPC","…so come back and we can compare notes. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_32_SergeantNikannen_NPC","And if I were you, I wouldn't mention Roald, the caravan, or anything else…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_33_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Slang","As the philosopher said, we must hang together or we'll hang separately! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_34_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Clear skies to you! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_35_SellswordOrElse_Slang","Clear skies, Sarge! Misaye's laughing!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_1_BaronStonefist_NPC","Greetings, adventurers. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_2_BaronStonefist_NPC","Sergeant Nikannen says you want to see me on some urgent matter?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_3_DiplomatOrAristocratOrElse_Normal","Yes. It concerns our traveling companion, Lady Kythaela."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_4_BaronStonefist_NPC","Then let her speak for herself!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_5_Kythaela_NPC","My lord, before the Cataclysm this valley was in the care of my family. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_6_Kythaela_NPC","Alas, only a few of us managed to survive - and none at all in the valley. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_7_BaronStonefist_NPC","A sad tale, my lady, but not uncommon. Those were dire times."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_8_Kythaela_NPC","My father passed away recently. Upon his death bed…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_9_Kythaela_NPC","…he mentioned some family heirlooms left in a hidden room somewhere in the fortress. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_10_Kythaela_NPC","With your leave, my lord…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_11_Kythaela_NPC","…I would like to search for this hidden room and retrieve my family's belongings."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_12_BaronStonefist_NPC","Out of the question! This is my castle and all in it belongs to me! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_13_BaronStonefist_NPC","Now begone - and be glad that, as a guest, you are protected by our customs…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_14_BaronStonefist_NPC","…otherwise, your impudence would land you in the dungeon!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Ah - you're back! How did the audience go? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_2_CynicOrElse_Normal","Clear skies! Well, he didn't imprison us, just threw us out! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Just threw you out? That's not like him at all!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_4_CynicOrElse_Normal","Oh? He's not always so generous to strangers?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_5_SergeantNikannen_NPC","No - just pragmatic and smart! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","Pragmatic?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_7_ChoiceA_Spoken","Pragmatic?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_8_SergeantNikannen_NPC","It would be cheaper to let you find the heirlooms, under close escort."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_9_SergeantNikannen_NPC","He'd demand a fee, but it's easier than having to search for himself!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","Smart?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_11_ChoiceB_Spoken","Smart?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Of course, smart! If we assume Lady Kythaela's story is true…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC","…then arresting her or coercing her could have drawn the ire of an elven clan."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_14_SergeantNikannen_NPC","A pretty stupid move for stuff which might only have sentimental value! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_15_SergeantNikannen_NPC","So, not like Gromnir at all!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_16_SellswordOrElse_Normal","Fine. What do you suggest? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Let me make some preparations. You go back to him tomorrow…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC","…as envoys of the Legacy Council!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","So, what's the plan?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_1_Baron_NPC","Sergeant Nikannen, why are you bringing these people to me again?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC","My lord, they showed me credentials that I thought you should see."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_3_Baron_NPC","Credentials? What do credentials have to do with Lady Kythaela's claims? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_4_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal","We're from the Legacy Council."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_5_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal","My lord, we are deputies of the Legacy Council!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_6_Baron_NPC","And the Legacy Council interferes in Coparann's affairs?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_7_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","Quite the contrary, my lord…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_8_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","…the Council would appreciate Coparann's help."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_9_Baron_NPC","Why didn't you say so yesterday? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_10_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","We do not flaunt our allegiance unless there is need, my lord!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_11_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","Lady Kythaela works for the Legacy Council."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_12_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","Lady Kythaela has agreed to help the Council…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_13_AcademicOrElse_Normal","…in a delicate and vital matter."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_14_Baron_Normal","And what's that?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Historical research."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_16_Baron_NPC","Those… baubles have some historical value?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_17_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","We believe so, my lord. We wouldn't be here otherwise."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_18_Baron_NPC","Then why not just say so?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Confidential matters are best handled confidentially, my lord."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_20_Baron_NPC","Then - ah, shall we search for these heirlooms together? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_21_Baron_NPC","I shall escort you and we'll inventory the… historical items."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_22_Baron_NPC","Then we can discuss a reasonable share for the keep."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_23_Kythaela_NPC","That would be more than fair, my lord!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_24_Baron_NPC","Then please lead the way! Where should we start? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_25_Kythaela_NPC","In the basement, my lord! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_26_Baron_NPC","Let's go, then! Nikannen, you were right to bring them to me! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_27_Baron_NPC","Now, back to your post!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Yes, my lord!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_29_MeetYouThere","Go. I'll meet you in the basement."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_1_Kythaela_NPC","Here! This is the place! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_2_Baron_NPC","And so near the dungeons. How subtle - and fitting. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_3_Baron_NPC","Please, Lady Kythaela, before we inventory your heirlooms…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_4_Baron_NPC","…there is something I wish to show you."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_5_Baron_NPC","You will find it interesting, hopefully."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_6_Baron_NPC","So nice of you to drop by. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_7_Baron_NPC","Now we shall all have a nice, long chat together! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_8_Baron_NPC","And you will tell us everything!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_9_Baron_NPC","Ah - and guards… Gromnir has outlived his usefulness!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_10_EinarOrElse_Formal","Einar be your judge! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_11_Baron_NPC","And you will give me that Crown!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_12_SeeingTheBaron","Is that… the Baron?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_1_Baron_NPC","Lady Kythaela, dear friends - words aren't enough to convey my thanks! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_2_Baron_NPC","Your swift action has saved my life - and our vale! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_3_Baron_NPC","We shall be more wary of the Council's warnings…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_4_Baron_NPC","…the Soraks are real."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_5_Baron_NPC","This changes our position towards the Council."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","Warnings?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","About the Council…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_8_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","About the Soraks…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_9_ChoiceA_Spoken","The Council warned you?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_10_Baron_NPC","Indeed. I thought they exaggerated, alas!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_11_Baron_NPC","If anything, they weren't loud enough!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_12_DiplomatOrElse_Default","But we can only warn! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_13_Ceannard_NPC","You are right to do so, but in such matters, only conviction and proof are effective!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_14_SellswordOrElse_Slang","Soraks are real - you saw them with your own eyes."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Their presence was a clear message: be wary! Be careful!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_16_Ceannard_NPC","True! We won't let our guard down! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_17_Any_Default","How does this change your position?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_18_Ceannard_NPC","Coparann must stand with the Council!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Do you plan to join the Council?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_20_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Or simply to help us in our endeavors? "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_21_Ceannard_NPC","We shall join! The discovery of the hidden Gate…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_22_Ceannard_NPC","…will allow us to communicate swiftly!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_23_Ceannard_NPC","But enough about matters of state!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_24_Baron_NPC","The Ceannard has the right of it! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_25_Baron_NPC","The only benefit of power is the ability to reward friends!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_26_Ceannard_NPC","And true friends of Coparann you have proven to be!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_27_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal","Thanks for your kind words! We feel quite rewarded."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_28_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Hush, you! Ceannard, Lord Stonefist - many thanks for your kind words!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_29_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","And praise be your resilience, so we could rescue you alive!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_30_Baron_NPC","That resilience would have amounted to nothing…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_31_Baron_NPC","…without your insight and your courage! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_32_Baron_NPC","You are hereby granted permanent citizenship of Coparann, with all associated rights!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_33_Baron_NPC","As well as free use of our rediscovered Gate!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_34_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal","The keys to the town, maybe?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_35_Baron_NPC","And these gems from our mines are well suited to holding enchantments."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_36_Baron_NPC","Go forth on your journey with our blessings!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_37_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Many thanks for your generous gifts! May Einar watch over Coparann!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_1_Kythaela_NPC","This is the place!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_2_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal","And it's had recent visitors. Look here in the mud - a boot print."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_3_Perception15Success_Normal","And the rain has only just stopped! Let's be careful!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_4_Perception15Failure_Normal","Difficult to read anything here."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_5_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal","Lady Kythaela! Do you know how to enter the Tower?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_6_Kythaela_NPC","Yes!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_7_Crownbearer_Normal","Let's head there now! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_8_BroodB_NPC","Not so fast!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_9_BroodD_NPC","The feast is just starting!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_10_BroodF_NPC","And you will make a nice main dish!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_1_Kythaela_NPC","Master, here I am, at last!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_2_Adrasteia_NPC","Kythaela, come to me! "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_3_Starter_Normal","Kythaela could use some healing, I think!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_6_Razan_NPC","Yes, dazzle us! Allow me to thank you for your actions!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_7_Razan_NPC","I have tried for years to open that door! And here you are!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_8_Razan_NPC","An answer to my prayers! It would almost lead me to believe…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_9_Razan_NPC","…in the benevolence of the gods! Albeit my very existence proves otherwise!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_1_Adrasteia_NPC","You have my thanks, whoever you are."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_2_Crownbearer_Normal","You're welcome, I guess. But your thanks for what exactly? "
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_3_Adrasteia_NPC","For reuniting me with Kythaela."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_4_Adrasteia_NPC","For dealing with this… foulness when I was incapacitated."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_5_Adrasteia_NPC","This evil was new to me, not something Manacalon ever knew."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","Reuniting? "
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_7_ChoiceA_Spoken","Reunited with her?"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_8_Adrasteia_NPC","Yes, Kythaela was - or even is - a part of me! "

"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal","Careful, now!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_11_Adrasteia_NPC","No, It is also me speaking, my friend, and your care is much appreciated!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_12_Insight_20_Success_Normal","Kythaela was your clone? "
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_13_Insight_20_Failure_Normal","I don't understand what happened here!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_14_Adrasteia_NPC","Kythaela was a last-ditch contingency - one I didn't truly think I would ever need!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_15_Adrasteia_NPC","A vessel for my knowledge and memories!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_16_AcademicOrElse_Normal","But how did she awaken, a thousand years after the Cataclysm? "
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_17_Adrasteia_NPC","The revival process was tied to an ambient level of mana."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_18_AcademicOrElse_Normal","Very high-level magic, then!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_19_Adrasteia_NPC","One of the secrets of the Arcaneum, yes!"

"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_23_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","Never seen such a creature?"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_24_ChoiceC_Normal","Never met such a creature before? "
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_25_Adrasteia_NPC","No. Manacalon, for all its faults, revered life!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_26_Adrasteia_NPC","This was a negation of life, an abomination!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_27_AcademicOrElse_Normal","Manacalon? Are you one of the… ?"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_28_Adrasteia_NPC","Adrasteia the Prudent Shield, Master of Abjuration. In your debt, and at your service! "

"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_30_Adrasteia_NPC","Yes, and there I must apologize for Kythaela's misconceptions."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_31_AcademicOrElse_Normal","Misconceptions? "
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_32_Adrasteia_NPC","Yes. She was created with an elven personality, and carried certain… prejudices."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_33_AcademicOrElse_Normal","Oh, that."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_34_Adrasteia_NPC","The Empire wasn't kind to… other races."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_35_AcademicOrElse_Normal","The humans surprised you, it seems."

"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_37_Adrasteia_NPC","They all came together to save Solasta! "
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_38_Adrasteia_NPC","The Golden Cavalry charging and breaking the lines of the Sorr-Akkath! "

"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_41_Adrasteia_NPC","Our shock arcanists and the human paladins together…"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_42_Adrasteia_NPC","…giving their lives to give us a chance to close the Rift!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_43_Adrasteia_NPC","And, as another wave came through…"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_44_Adrasteia_NPC","…one last throw of the dice…"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_45_Adrasteia_NPC","…one last surprise for the Sorr-Akkath! "
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_46_AcademicOrElse_Normal","What was it?"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_47_Adrasteia_NPC","Kaseinax had us walking Solasta in elven form for so long…"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_48_Adrasteia_NPC","…but at this moment we resumed our true forms!"

"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_54_Crownbearer_Normal","Old friend?"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_55_Adrasteia_NPC","I feel your spirit in the Crown, Kaseinax! "
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_56_AcademicOrElse_normal","The Magister is still in the Crown? "
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_57_Adrasteia_NPC","Enough talk of the past."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC","Please accept these few tokens of my gratitude!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC2","I must rest now. I foresee one last flight, when the need is greatest…"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_59_Adrasteia_NPC","…and for that, I will need all my strength."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_59_Adrasteia_NPC2","Use my Gate freely. I believe you know how."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC","We shall meet again, before the end!"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC2","But before you take your leave, if you would be so kind…"
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC3","This creature you forced to flee still plagues my grounds with his minions."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_61_Adrasteia_NPC","Would you deal with them and free their prisoners? "
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_62_Adrasteia_NPC","As a courtesy."
"Narration/&AbjurationEnding_63_Any_Default","We owe you that much. Thank you, Master Adrasteia."

"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_4_Kythaela_NPC","I… don't know. There is only one word written on the paper: ""Adrasteo"""

"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_8_SarcasticOrElse_Normal","More monsters to kill… fantastic…"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_9_PerceptionHighest_Normal","What about that door? Another secret from Imperial times?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_1_ArcanaHighest_Normal","A Major Gate! Captain Ironshell was right."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_2_Sarcastic_Normal","About the cleanliness of the rooms in the Residence?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_3_ArcanaHighest_Normal","About functional Gates, you dimwit!"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_4_Sarcastic_Normal","This dusty old room?   "

"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_10_Kythaela_NPC","You need to use its name. "
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_11_Kythaela_NPC","It would normally be engraved nearby, but this was a private, secret Gate."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_12_Pragmatic_Normal","So, we can't use it?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_13_Kythaela_NPC","I know its name, this was my family's."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_14_Pragmatic_Normal","So…?"
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_15_Kythaela_NPC","Once you get me to my master, I'll give you the name."

"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_15_Pragmatic_Default","She might know something about the gem."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_16_Save_Default","She's helpless! Let's show mercy for once."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_17_Kill_Slang","No glory in slaughtering someone who's already down."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_18_Kill_Formal","I say we save her life - even if she probably wouldn't do the same for us."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_19_Medecine_Default","I'll take care of that - she'll be on her feet very soon."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_20_Leave_Default","Who cares? Let's keep looking for the gem."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_21_Speak_Default","What's the risk, here? She's alone and wounded."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_22_Arcana_Default","She's a shaman. She could cast a spell on us."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_23_Pragmatic_Default","Maybe she knows something about the gem."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_24_Nosy_Default","To be honest, I'd like to know what happened here. Who killed all those orcs?"

"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_5_Radulf_Default","Not enough to stop Arrok."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_6_Joker_Default","With Bladefang, Brok may be strong enough."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_7_Radulf_Default","Signs are with Arrok."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_8_Cynical_Default","He's good, this shaman. Guy burns down a whole tribe, and he sees the signs."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_9_Authority_Default","Shut up."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_10_Radulf_NPC","Arrok has stone of power."

"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_26_Selfpres_Default","Why not?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_27_Pragmatic_Default","Anyway, I don't think we have much choice."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangMeeting_28_Pragmatic_Default","We'll get your holy axe."

"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_6_Selfpres_Default","What kind of monster?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_7_Kebra_NPC","Do not know. Plenty go after holy axe, no one comes back to tell."

"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_5_Selfpres_Default","This is insane! Let's go back!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_6_Selfpres_Default","I'd rather kill all the orcs in that damned volcano than walk down this spider pit in the pitch dark."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_7_Pragmatic_Default","There has to be a way."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_1_Cynical_Default","I promise I'll never scoff at 'anything is possible in the Badlands' again."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_2_Pragmatic_Default","At least we got it."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_3_Pragmatic_Default","Hopefully, that means another orc tribe behind us."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_4_Greed_Default","You really want to give up this axe?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_5_Greed_Default","Look at it? it's a masterpiece!"

"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_12_Radulf_NPC","But axe is orc inheritance."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_13_Greed_Default","It's Tirmarian, not orc."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_14_Radulf_NPC","Pah! Should know better than trust nyarks!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_15_Radulf_NPC","Leave Bladefang. Now."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_1_Default_Default","Look at that! Another library!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_2_Default2_Default","It looks very like the tower where we found the Crown."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_3_History_Default","But it's makeshift, not Manacalon."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_4_Kebra_NPC","Home of Sandraven, and Shaman Urka."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_5_Nosy_WRITTEN","Why the Manacalon style?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","Tell us about the Sandraven tribe."

"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_13_Pragmatic_Default","What should we know about Sandraven?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_14_Kebra_NPC","Urka loves old elf stuff."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_15_Kebra_NPC","Ask you to bring back some, for sure."

"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_17_Authority_Default","Let's do this. I think they've seen us, anyway."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_18_Urka_NPC","Kebra?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_19_Urka_NPC","I thought you were dead."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_20_Urka_NPC","Who are your nyark… friends?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_21_Kebra_NPC","They help me and Brok. We gather all tribes against Arrok."

"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_27_Authority_Default","What's that?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_28_Urka_NPC","Down in the Cradle of Fire is a Manacalon city called Sentharyllian."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_29_Urka_NPC","It melted into the mountain, since the Great Collapse."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_30_Urka_NPC","But Arrok… he found it first."

"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_32_Urka_NPC","Now, no one can enter, unless…"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_33_Urka_NPC","…unless you go through the Necropolis."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_34_Urka_NPC","Find the Emperor's key."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_35_Urka_NPC","Bring it back to me, and my tribe will support Suncloud."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_36_Choice1_WRITTEN","It's a deal!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_37_Choice2_WRITTEN","Arrok is already in the city."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_38_Choice3_WRITTEN","The Emperor's key?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_39_Choice4_WRITTEN","It must be very dangerous."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_40_Choice4_Default","If Arrok the powerful didn't go there, it must be awfully dangerous."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_41_Urka_NPC","Not more than facing Arrok without help."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_42_Choice3_Default","What is this key?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_43_Urka_NPC","It is said that the Emperor was buried with a magical key that opens the city."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_44_Urka_NPC","So find his tomb and bring me the key."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_45_Choice2_Default","Why do you want that key if Arrok is already inside the city?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_46_Urka_NPC","Arrok only found a part of the city."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_47_Urka_NPC","The key will open many more rooms… to me."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_48_Choice1_Default","All right, we'll bring you the key."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_1_Default_Default","I think that's the Necropolis."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_2_Selfpres_Default","Orcs don't go there? I really can't see why."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_3_Authority_Default","Let's go find this key."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_1_Default_Default","That's a change of mood."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_2_Nosy_Default","Fantastic! It's like traveling back in time a thousand years!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_3_Selfpres_Default","Well, it still stinks of sulfur."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_1_Default_Default","So far, this looks more like a museum than a crypt."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_2_History_Default","Manacalon custom. The tombs of the powerful have a hall of honor before the burial chamber."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_3_Greed_Default","It's a map of the Manacalon Empire! It must be a thousand years old - maybe more!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_4_Cynical_Default","So, they really did rule the world."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_5_Greed_Default","This is invaluable. I should compare it to our own map."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_6_History_Default","Here - this is Hickory Corner Wood! I've been there, and there's nothing but an old statue. The map shows an outpost!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_7_Pragmatic_Default","Maybe it's buried, like this city."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_8_Authority_Default","Let's put that on our map - maybe someday we can go check it out."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_1_History_Default","We have our answer - this isn't just any tomb."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_2_Cynical_Default","Yeah, it's a damned Imperial slaver's tomb."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_3_Lawful_Default","We know…"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_4_History_Default","This one was Laethar Aerlinn, first of his name."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_5_Pragmatic_Default","In the middle of the Badlands, and not in the capital city? That's weird."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_6_History_Default","It might have been displaced during the Cataclysm and sunk down here. "
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_7_Lawful_Default","I would have expected something bigger, fancier."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_8_Cynical_Default","Maybe he was a modest Emperor - if such a thing's possible."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_9_Authority_Default","We still need to find an entrance to the city. Let's go!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_1_History_Default","Prince Kealin, firstborn."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_2_Violent_Default","His son? Never got to be Emperor - died too soon."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_3_Cynical_Default","Murdered, most likely. Happy families, and all that."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_4_Authority_Default","Let's go."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_1_History_Default","Queen Saefinala, dearest wife and mother."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_2_Cynical_Default","Cute."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_3_Lawful_Default","Show some respect."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_4_Carver_Default","Slavers, the whole lot of them."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_1_Ghost_NPC","Who dares disturb the eternal rest of Emperor Laethar?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_2_Default_WRITTENONLY","We mean no disrespect."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_3_Deception_WRITTENONLY","We got lost."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_4_Persuasion_WRITTENONLY","We're clearing your city of orcs."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_5_Intimidation_WRITTENONLY","We go where we like."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_6_Intimidation_Answer01","This isn't your world anymore - we can go wherever we like!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_7_Ghost_NPC","Fool!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_8_Ghost_NPC","Your souls will never leave this tomb!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_9_Persuasion_Answer02","Your city is infested with orcs. We're here to clean it up."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_10_Ghost_NPC","What are orcs?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_11_Cynical_Default","Smart move!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_12_Persuasion_Default","Evil monsters. They're desecrating your city."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_13_Deception_Answer03","We just got lost, sorry."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_14_Ghost_NPC","Lies of a tomb robber!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_15_Default_Answer04","We mean no disrespect."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_16_Ghost_NPC","Then what do you mean?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_17_Ghost_NPC","Monsters, you say? "
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_18_Ghost_NPC","Clearly, you are runaway slaves. You will be punished!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_19_Violent_Slang","I've had enough of this. Let's kill this loser - again!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_20_Violent_Normal","Enough of this! Let's wipe this slaver's ghost from Solasta!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_21_Persuasion_Default","We call them orcs, they're like… dwarves, but worse."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_22_Ghost_NPC","Really?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_23_Ghost_NPC","Then you are on a sacred mission."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_24_Ghost_NPC","Monsters must not defile a city of the Emperors."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_25_Ghost_NPC","Leave this holy tomb and do what you must."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_26_Ghost_NPC","There is Minor Gate by the tapestry of the Aer Elai. Use it to reach the inner city."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_27_Persuasion_Default","Thank you, your Imperial Majesty."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_1_Pragmatic_Default","Did you see that?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_2_Cynical_Default","The ghost? Yes, we did."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_3_Pragmatic_Default","The key! It's in the coffin."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_4_Selfpres_Default","Oh, no!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_5_Pragmatic_Default","So what do we do?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_6_Cynical_Default","Wake him up again and ask nicely?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_7_Violent_Default","Get ready for a fight."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_8_Pragmatic_Default","Why don't we just go into the city and kill Arrok?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_9_Selfpres_Default","Which is worse? Fighting Arrok by ourselves, or this dead Emperor?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_1_Ghost_NPC","You again?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_2_Cynical_Normal","Sorry, your Imperialness. We just need that pretty key of yours."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_3_Cynical_Formal","Our apologies, Emperor, but your time has long gone."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_4_Cynical_Slang","Time to die for good, dead boy!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_5_Ghost_NPC","Liars! Traitors!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_1_Authority_Default","Urka!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_2_Urka_NPC","I must say, I am impressed."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_3_Selfpres_Default","You followed us?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_4_Urka_NPC","So you don't have to bring the key back to me."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_5_Selfpres_Default","You really want that key, don't you?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_6_Urka_NPC","Actually, I wanted the ghost to weaken you."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_7_Urka_NPC","Make it easier to take that Crown from you."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_1_Kebra_NPC","Urka? How? I know him since… child."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_2_Lawful_Default","The Soraks - the gaks - they got to him, I guess."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_3_Kebra_NPC","But, all these orcs, too?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_4_History_Default","The Soraks took over a whole world back on Tirmar."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_5_Kebra_NPC","The Crown? It can stop them?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_6_Authority_Default","We think so - hope so."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_7_Kebra_NPC","You need Arrok's stone, for real."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_1_Brok_NPC","Nyark friends. You convince the tribes?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_2_Authority_Default","Bad news. Urka was corrupted by the gaks."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_3_Brok_NPC","Urka? Big mind like him?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_4_Kebra_NPC","I saw him. Like crazy. The gaks can do this."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_5_Brok_NPC","Maybe Arrok is gak, too?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_6_Authority_Default","Doesn't matter now, we need to take the fight to him."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_7_Brok_NPC","But Sandraven?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_8_Kebra_NPC","You choose a chief for them, and they follow you."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_9_Default_Default","Also, Radulf will not come."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_10_Default_Default","We couldn't reach an agreement."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_11_Brok_NPC","Hm. Meet us near Redscar gate."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_12_Default_Player","What is that?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_13_Brok_NPC","Redscar gate. Arrok's fortress."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_14_Violence_Player","Can't we just kill the guards and go in?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_15_Brok_NPC","Door is magic. "
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_16_Brok_NPC","But Arrok will open if challenged."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_17_Brok_NPC","We need the tribes."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_1_History_NPC","Can't get used to these Minor Gates. To think they had these everywhere!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_2_Pragmatic_Default","Now's not the time for Manacalon nostalgia."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_3_Kebra_NPC","Look!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_4_Authority_Default","Is that…?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_5_Kebra_NPC","Arrok!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_6_Cynical_Default","That did the trick, eh?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_7_Selfpres_Default","What are these burned corpses everywhere?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_8_Kebra_NPC","Orcs. Didn't please Arrok, I suppose."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_9_Cynical_Default","Well, looks like he did half the job for us."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_10_Authority_NPC","Do we need the tribes, now?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_11_Violent_NPC","I reckon we can take him - we have the advantage of surprise."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_12_Kebra_NPC","Arrok still very powerful."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_13_Violent_NPC","Sure. So we need to take him down fast."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_14_Selfpres_NPC","We can still backtrack and follow the plan."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_1_Cynical_Default","Uh-huh."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_2_Arrok_NPC","Ah, Kebra of Suncloud…"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_3_Arrok_NPC","…you walk with nyarks? Shame on you."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_4_Authority_Default","You're finished, Arrok. Give us the stone!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_5_Arrok_NPC","Funny nyark. No, you give me yours."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_6_Authority_Default","You're alone. Looks like you killed your tribe all by yourself."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_7_Arrok_NPC","Useless worms."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_8_Arrok_NPC","Arrok needs no orcs. Arrok is fire! Arrok is volcano!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_9_Selfpres_Default","What the…"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_1_Authority_Default","Brok!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_2_Authority_Default","Where are the guards?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_3_Brok_NPC","Surrendered."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_4_Default_Default","What?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_5_Brok_NPC","So afraid of Arrok, they joined us already."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_6_Cynical_Default","No big speech, then?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_7_Brok_NPC","No, but door still closed."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_8_Crownbearer_Default","Do you see that?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_9_Cynical_Default","The door?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_10_Crownbearer_Default","No, there is a… power."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_11_Crownbearer_Default","I think, though… with the Crown… we might be able to enter."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_12_Selfpres_Default","It's a trap. Arrok wants us in there alone."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_13_Pragmatic_Default","Do we have a choice?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_14_Default_Default","There's always the Necropolis."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_1_Nosy_Default","Is that gem more powerful than the others?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_2_Arcane_Default","Orc shamans wield a very peculiar type of magic…"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_3_Arcane_Default","…the gem must have been some sort of catalyst."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_4_Pragmatic_Default","Well, we have it now. Let's move before this place blows up!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_1_Selfpres_Default","That was close!"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_2_Friendly_Default","What do you think happened to…"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_3_Friendly_NPC","…our orc friends?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_4_Selfish_Default","You mean yours. They're no friends of mine."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_5_Violent_Default","Burned dead… who cares?"
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_6_Friendly_Default","They seem more civilized than I expected."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_7_Violent_Default","Next time we run into some, you can tell them that."
"Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_8_Authority_Default","All right, let's get out of here. It's not safe!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_1_Crownbearer_Default","This is it, I think! It's just behind this wall of vegetation!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_2_CynicOrElse_Default","You think? That's comforting. And how do we get through? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default","Just hack and slash, rinse and repeat, until we're through! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4a_CynicOrElse_Default","I've heard that before…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4b_CynicOrElse_Default","…a couple of hundred times since we started…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4c_HighestCharismaIfNotCynicOrnotCynic_Default","Oh, come on! Less bitching and more hacking!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_5_LowestSTRorElse_Default","I so love manual labor! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_6_FollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default","It's Maraike's will!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_1_CynicOrElse_Default","I think my arm's about to drop off from all this hacking!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_2_SellswordorElse_Slang","Chop, don't talk!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default","Come on, guys! It's just another hedge! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_4_LowestSTRorElse_Default","Last freakin' hedge I intend to cut through in my lifetime! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_5_RogueOrFollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default","Misaye's laughing!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_1_LowestSTRorElse_Default","Such a wonderful coincidence to get a sauna after all the physical exertion!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_2_SellswordorElse_Slang","Stop moaning - it was just a nice warm-up!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default","I have dealt with worse! Not often, though!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_4_CynicOrElse_Default","Hard to believe! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_5_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default","Einar strike down me if I lie!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_1_SpyOrElse_Default","Now, my friend - it's time for a little chat."
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_2_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","I'll give you nothing! Sorr-Tarr will protect me from your torture!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_3_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","He isn't here, Two-Face - but I am!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_4_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","This place will be the death of you, too! It is cursed! Its magic is twisted!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","This place? How did you get here? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_Written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","How did you come to this place? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6a_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","We were sent by our chosen one! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","An acolyte of Sorr-Tarr…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6a1_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","Blessed be his name."
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a1_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","How did he locate the place? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a2_Intimidation_DC20_Default","Ever heard of the Inquisition? Talk to us now!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8a1_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Success_NPC","The chosen one worked some magic. "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8a2_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Failure_NPC","The Inquisition? Pah! Nothing you can do to me can beat the horrors of this place!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","This place is cursed? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","What curse? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","Don't you have eyes? Didn't you see the fate of my brethren?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","Won't lose sleep over it! What is cursed? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","This very place! Everything seemed peaceful, and then…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_9b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","Who said what? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_10b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","The voice! It said we would all die!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_11b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","Because I know we will all die here! It said so! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_12_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","Disturbing claims! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_13_SpyOrCautious_Default","Sure, all these dead Soraks, and no trace of what killed them…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_14_SpyOrCautious_Default","…but we saw dead Soraks everywhere…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_15_SpyOrCautious_Default","…and not one single enemy body among them! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_16_Lawkeeper_Default","They could have taken their dead, just like the Soraks do."
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_17_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","And what do we do with our friend here? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_18_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","He is a Sorak pawn - there is only one thing to do! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_19_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","And yet, we have laws! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_20_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","He's too dangerous! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_21_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","Who are we, to call ourselves judges and executioners?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_22_AnyPriestOrPaladin_Default","Servants of the gods!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_23_AnyNonHuman_Default","Protectors of Solasta!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default","Those statues look weird!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_2_Sellsword_Slang","Perhaps - but those chests look mighty real to me!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_3_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","But are we entitled to it? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_4_Sellsword_Slang","What do you mean? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_5_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","So far, we haven't met a living soul in this labyrinth!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_6_CynicOrElse_Default","And your point being?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_7_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","That we would be stealing from the owner!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_8_SellswordOrGreed_Default","Naaah - spoils of war!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","But we want his help, remember - stealing makes a bad impression, usually."
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_10_SellswordOrGreed_Default","Can we just take a peek first? We don't have to take anything. "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_11_SellswordOrGreed_Default","Just a look, right? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_12_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","All right, but don't make me regret it! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_13_SellswordOrGreed_Default","Oooops… Sorry? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_1_Beast_NPC","And so the thieves come to meet their doom!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_2_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal","There are no thieves here! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_3_Beast_NPC","Do you deny helping yourselves to the riches outside this room?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_4_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal","We were looking for clues and then we were attacked…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default","…by some constructs that really, really wanted to kill us!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_6_Beast_NPC","Hah! The constructs wouldn't have attacked…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_7_Beast_NPC","…if you had just looked! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_8a_SellswordOrGreed_Default","Had to make sure they weren't fake!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_8b_LawkeeperOrAltruist_Default","We didn't even have a chance to put them back! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_9_Beast_NPC","You stole! Otherwise, there would have been no fight! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_10_Beast_NPC","And there is only one punishment for theft!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_11_Beast_NPC","Death!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_1_SellswordOrGreed_Slang","This is my kind of fight!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_2_Crownbearer_Default","Well, I can relate to that, but I also wonder… "
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default","Wonder about what?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_4_Crownbearer_Default","Why all of this? Why the traps, why the fights?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_5_NosyOElse_Default","Not to forget the how! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_6_Crownbearer_Default","This gem fragment… resonates with the Crown but…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_7_NosyOElse_Default","Apparently, the gem was split… to protect it, maybe? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_8_Crownbearer_Default","That would explain the traps and monsters."
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_9_NosyOElse_Default","It's one way to make sure this gem is safe! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Default","But what does it mean?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_NosyOElse_Default","That another Master survived the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_11_Cynic_Default","Someone who doesn't like visitors. "
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","What was that? Where are we? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_2_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal","You had to step on it! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_3_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal","Find us a way back! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_4_NosyOrElse_Formal","Friends, we'll have to think this through! We're a team."
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_5_CynicOrElse_Normal","And watch where you put your hands in future."
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_6_SellswordOrGreed_Normal","Don't you loot everything you find?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_7_NosyOrElse_Normal","I'm not a Scavenger, mind you."
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_8_SellswordOrGreed_Normal","Stop it!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_9_SellswordOrGreed_Normal","…while we wait for you to finish pondering all the…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_10_SellswordOrGreed_Formal","…theoretical and practical implications of everything we do?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_11_NosyOrElse_Normal","Nothing wrong with using one's brain, my musclebound friend!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_12_CrownbearerOrAuthority_Normal","Enough! Let's find a way out of this trap…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_13_CrownbearerOrAuthority_Normal","By brawn or brains, I don't care which!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","I just felt something!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_2_NosyOrElse_Normal","Like what? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","Like the floor gave a little under my weight! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_4_NosyOrElse_Formal","Well, this tile does look a little different! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_5_NosyOrElse_Normal","Spread out! Look for similar tiles!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_6_SelfishnessOrGreed_Normal","What's in it for me? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_7_NosyOrElse_Normal","A way out! Unless you have a better idea?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","It worked! The platform shifted!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_2_NosyOrElse_Normal","True - but we're not out of this… labyrinth yet! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","True!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_4_NosyOrElse_Formal","We've made progress, though! Let's keep going!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_5_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","Let's spread out and explore!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_6_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal","Professional trap-finders first!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_7_RogueOrHighestPerception_Normal","Did someone just call for my expertise? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","Interesting light, that. Very bright."
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_2_nosyOrElse_Normal","Wonder what it's about?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","Only one way to find out! Come on!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_4_Arcana_DC20_Failure_Normal","Looks like a will-o'-the-wisp to me! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_5_Arcana_DC20_Success_Normal","How fascinating! A new wonder to behold! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_6_RogueOrElse_Normal","Not so fast! There have been enough traps so far to…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_7_RogueOrElse_Normal","…make me really nervous!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_8_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal","You and me both, my friend! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_9_Crownbearer_Normal","Let's tread carefully, then! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_10_RogueOrAcolyte_Normal","Today is Misaye's birthday! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_11_ClericOrWorshipMaraike_Normal","Maraike's will be done! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_12_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal","Next time, pray harder for a miracle! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_1_HighestPerception_Slang","Einar's sword! What a sight! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_2_NosyOrHistoryOrElse_Formal","Unbelievable!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_3_HistoryDC15_Success_Formal","A classical Manacalon manor! What a wonderful sight! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_4_HistoryDC15_Failure_Formal","What a weird old building!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_5_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal","Guys, I move two steps back and well… it's gone!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_6_HighestPerception_Normal","What is gone? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_7_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal","This manor! Something weird is going on!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_8_HighestPerception_Normal","Story of my life!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_9_CynicOrElse_Normal","Weird gets us money and fame! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_10_AcolytOrElse_Normal","Do you really have to be so… greedy?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_11_CynicOrElse_Normal","Not greedy; practical! We do things…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_12_CynicOrElse_Normal","…that no one in their right minds would attempt…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_13_CynicOrElse_Normal","…and we don't do it for nothing!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_14_HelpfulnessOrFriendliness_Normal","Speak for yourself! A good deed is a good deed!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_15_CynicOrElse_Normal","Then let's get in there and see what kind of weirdness we find!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_1_Butler_NPC","Good day to you. My name is Eldorath Smooth-Tongue, the master's housekeeper."
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2a_1_Butler_ifPlayersLooted_NPC","I see you have purloined some of my master's property…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2a_2_Butler_ifPlayersLooted_NPC","…might I suggest you put those trinkets back where they belong? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2b_1_Butler_ifPlayersNoLoot_NPC","Welcome."
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2b_2_Butler_ifPlayersNoLoot_NPC","Please come with me."
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_3_CrownbearerOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","Clear skies to you! Where are you taking us?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_4_Butler_NPC","To the master, of course! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_5_Crownbearer_Normal","And who would that be? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_6_Butler_NPC","That is for not for me to say. All will be made plain in good time."
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_7_Butler_NPC","I am at your disposal. Please enjoy our hospitality - but…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_8_Butler_NPC","…please don't abuse it."
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","We are grateful for your hospitality."
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_written_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Hospitality? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10a_Butler_NPC","We aim to please. The household has certain standards, after all."
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11a_Butler_NPC","We have not seen guests of your… quality for some time."
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Some time? How long, exactly? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13a_Butler_NPC","Well, it must be… forgive me, the date eludes me for the moment."
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_14a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Do you remember any… prominent guests? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_15a_Butler_NPC","You were there, Master Kaseinax!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_16a_Crownbearer_Normal","Me? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_17a_Butler_NPC","I remember it distinctly. Though your form was somewhat different."
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","We would never dream of abusing your hospitality!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9b_written_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Someone abused your hospitality in the past?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10b_Butler_NPC","Yes, believe it or not, some… creatures can be…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11b_Butler_NPC","…insufferably rude!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","True nobility is reflected in the character!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13h_Butler_NPC","Quite so! Not, of course, that I thought for a second…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_14b_Butler_NPC","…that you would be capable of such discourtesy."
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_15b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Of course not! And yet, customs being different everywhere…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_16b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","…might I ask what would be considered rude here? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_17b_Butler_NPC","Well, my expectations don't exceed those of the Imperial court!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_18b_Cynic_Slang","So, don't piss in the potted plants, then? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_19b_Butler_NPC","Preferably not. Not that it would be the first time…"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_20b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Really? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_21b_Butler_NPC","I have seen worse, I'm sorry to say!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_22b_Butler_NPC","But now, please follow me. One mustn't keep the master waiting! "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_1_Master_NPC","Well met, strangers!"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_2_Master_IfplayersStole_NPC","Ah, my little thieving visitors."
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal","Clear skies to you, master."
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_4_Master_NPC","Clear skies? An ironic greeting, considering my plight! "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal","Your plight? "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_6_Master_NPC","That I haven't taken to the skies in a long time! "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_7_Master_NPC","It must have been a thousand years…"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_8_Master_NPC","I am… "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_9_Master_NPC","How weird, I can't recall my name…"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_10_Master_NPC","Call me master."
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_11_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal","Master of Conjuration!"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_12_Master_NPC","Yes, yes yes ! The Master of Conjuration! Exactly! "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_13_Crownbearer_Formal","Greetings, old friend!"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_14_AnyButCrownbearer_Normal","Why do you call him that?"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_15_Crownbearer_Normal","The Crown… told me to."
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_16_Master_NPC","Ah, the Crown…"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_17_Master_NPC","…thank you for coming to my rescue. "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_18_Master_NPC","My mind was shattered since the Cataclysm."
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_19_Master_NPC","The vanishing of mana left me broken."
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_20_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal","Mana was gone? "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_21_Master_NPC","Of course, after the closing of the Rift!"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_22_Master_NPC","That's why I and my siblings were killed or crippled."
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_23_Master_NPC","Kaseinax, and us, the masters, along with these deities…"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_24_Master_NPC","…we poured everything we had to close and seal that Rift! "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_25_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal","So the Cataclysm is… your fault? "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_26_Master_NPC","It was the price to pay to stop the threat."
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_27_Master_NPC","The Sorr-Akkath were and still are a menace to Solasta."
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_28_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal","And so you took a gamble? "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_29_Master_NPC","We were born to rule, not to grovel!"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_30_Master_NPC","And we had sworn to protect our people! "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_31_AnyNonElf_Normal","You mean your slaves?"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_32_Master_NPC","Fool! Imperial rule brought order where there was only chaos!"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_33_Master_NPC","But your empire was destroyed."
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_34_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal","Who knows how many elves were killed?"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_35_Master_NPC","Ah! Because you believe that Manacalon was an elven empire!"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_36_Master_NPC","Enough about the past! "
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_37_Master_NPC","Now I get that you want my gem."
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_38_Master_NPC","But even with his Crown, you're not my Magister!"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_39_Master_NPC","So, if you want it…"
"Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_40_Master_NPC","…you'll have to pry it from my dead claws!"
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_07","Kill them!"
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_08","Intruders!"
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_09","Don't let them get away!"
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_10","They're crazy!"
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_11","They'll kill us if we don't fight back!"
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_12","I stepped on some kind of magical rune. I guess there's a reason for that."
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_13","Found one!"
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_14","Eh… nothing. Very funny."
"Narration/&Banter_ToM_15","Another one, here."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Nego23_Spy_Default","Alright, I'm opening it."
"Narration/&Banter_SwitchToCautious","We should be careful."
"Narration/&PriestOfArun1_Priest_NPC","Sun on your face, travelers!"
"Narration/&PriestOfArun2_Arun_Default","Balance and harmony, chaplain!"
"Narration/&PriestOfArun3_Priest_NPC","Fair weather, faithful one."
"Narration/&PriestOfArun4_Priest_NPC","Good luck and fair weather!"
"Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_16_DalonLark_NPC","Did you find any relics of interest in our fight against the Sorr-Akkath?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_01","Charming little town…"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_02","Access to the canyon is blocked!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_03","You can't get to the other side - move on!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_04","You are not allowed to cross this bridge."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_01","Careful - I heard something!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_02","What were these goblins doing here?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_03","There must be some reason."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_04","Look - it works!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_05","It's something, isn't it?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_06","This is where they're coming from."
"Narration/&Atima_Bladeburn_Goodbye","Just passing by."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_DalonLark01","Clear skies, citizens!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HalmanSummer01","Clear skies, citizens!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HeddlonSurespell01","Clear skies, citizens!"

"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_03","Safe travels, adventurers!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_03","Watch yourselves outside - the roads are not safe!"
"Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LiamArrives","Liam! What are you doing here? I told you I'd take care of it!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel9_Default","Wait… Lisbath stayed back?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel10_Default","She was broken."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel11_Default","They're gonna kill her!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel12_Default","If we go back for her, we die, too."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel13_Default","But… Fine… you're probably right."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_01","There's something strange about this place."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_02","I feel like someone's watching us."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_03","Looks kinda familiar, don't you think?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_04","It's too quiet!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_05","This is huge!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_06","Did you see that?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_07","A Defiler. It vanished!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_08","We should be careful. We're not alone."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_01","Master, I'm coming!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_01","I can see something in the water."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_02","There's something under the ground."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_01","Friends are always welcome at the Shield!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_02","Peasants probably lived in these outbuildings."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_03","These walls seem to have been reinforced recently."

"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_05","Lore Text"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_06","That elf looks so military in that garb, and those symbols on the tabard! It can only be Empress Cylloriel Wildspirit!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_07","Lore about the hall"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_01","It doesn't do anything. Maybe we're missing something."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_02","We've dealt with this before."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_03","We should come back at night."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_09","A spectacular place, isn't it?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_10","Are they… ghosts?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_11","What other wonders does this place contain?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_12","Let's stay on guard."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_02","We're close now, I can feel it."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13_A","This magic goes far beyond our knowledge."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13_B","We can't go through here. It's too dangerous."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_09","Unbelievable, an intact copy of the History of the Elven Wars by the First Loremaster of the Arcaneum!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_10","This harp - look at the grain of this wood, the patina… it hasn't aged a day, seems anachronistic… And a 48-stringer!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_11","Knowing Manacalon, it could be anything! And I bet we don't have enough mana to make it work!"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_07","It looks like a pattern that needs to be reproduced in some way…"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_08","This is a poem in elvish… about the moonlight?"
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_09","Maybe this only works at night!"
"Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_19_Nope_Formal","We'll see what we can do."

"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_15","The… projections, they're all gone."
"Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_16","This must have something to do with Adrasteia's awakening."
"Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_4_Healer_Any_Normal","She doesn't have any wounds that I can see!"

"Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Greed_1","It's too easy… "
"Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_01","The gem, we found it!"
"Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_02","Where are the Soraks?"
"Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Beast_Observable_1","The gold just disappears in my hands!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_01","Edrof says gate closed for now."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_02","Bloodspear tribe is strong!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_03","Nyark go talk to Edrof. Only he give order to open passage."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_04","Brok strong chief! He defeated Edrof."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_01","Kebra survived! Kebra strong."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_02","Nyark want to trade?"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_03","Bloodspear strong tribe! Bloodspear plenty."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_04","Nyarks friend with Brok. Brok strong chief!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_01","Nyarks go see Radulf!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_02","Radulf great Shaman."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_03","Nyark got mighty axe?"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_04","Nyarks have spider webs in hair."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_01","Brok new chief? Brok not dead?"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_02","Nyarks need food?"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_03","Bladefang best tribe. Bladefang got big shaman!"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_04","Kebra friend with nyarks?"
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_01","Bring back the greataxe and I will consider an alliance."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_02","This sigil will unlock the door to my challenge."
"Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_03","No greataxe means we are not joining you."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_41_Player_Default","Go easy on him. He's just a harmless, old drunk."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_42_Player_Default","Probably saw lizardfolk, or dragonborn, or something…"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_43_Merton","You think I don't know the difference?"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_44_Merton","All those spines on their backs, those jaws - you've never seen anything like it!"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_45_Merton","Not lizardfolk, not troglodyte, not dragonborn. I'm telling you!"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_46_Player_Default","No one believes in Soraks anymore."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_47_Player_Default","Except the Church of Einar, of course - there's a Sorak under every bed if you believe them."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_48_Player_Default","Easy, now. Don't mock people for their faith."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_49_Merton","Read them books. Soraks are masters of deception, infiltration…"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_50_Merton","…anyone here could be a Sorak, you'd never know."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_51_Player_Default","Oh, come on!"
"Narration/&Tavern_02_51_Merton","You'll see."
"Narration/&Tavern_02_52_Player_Default","Anyway…"
"Narration/&Tavern_01_2b_Explorer_Default","Is this the place for the Legacy Council job? Hope I'm not too late."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Choiceb","The Council's very new. How does it work, exactly?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01b","Dear Maraike! You don't know?"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Player01b","Well, we know that each of the Eastern Kingdoms has a delegation…"
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02b","No - not the kingdoms. The Council is a neutral, academic body - in theory, at least."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03b","It's true, though, that each delegation is from a different nation."
"Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04b","Except for the Church of Einar. They are here to ensure fair dealings."
"Narration/&Council01_70b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","Our church has been warning of the Sorr-Akkath since humans first came to Solasta…"
"Narration/&Council01_71b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","…in the wake of their foul god Sorr-Tarr!"
"Narration/&Council03_37b_Einarboss_NPC","Their foul god Sorr-Tarr knows. He is guiding them."
"Narration/&Council03_37c_Einarboss_NPC","We tried to leave him - and them - behind on Tirmar. It seems we failed."
"Narration/&Council03_41b_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Conjecture perhaps, but the evidence points in that direction."
"Narration/&Council03_42b_Einarboss_NPC","Now they want the Crown. We may not know why, but we do know they must not have it!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_01","Yes… I understand."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_02","Who are you talking to? Wait - what are you doing?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_03","Are you crazy? Why did you put it on?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_04","We have no idea what it does, whether it's evil, or anything!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_05","What? I… Oh. I… It… I just… kind of… had to."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_06","We're supposed to share the loot, by the way."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_08","Forget it, let's get out of here."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_39b_Fighter_Default","Are they all undead in there?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_41_Default","Undead? What other abominations are in there?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_42_Default","Undead? What types? Are they free or enslaved?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_43_Default","Undead? That's not good. And you deal with them?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_44_Default","Undead. I might have known. Anything goes out here, it seems."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_06b_Intimidate_Default","There's nowhere in the world where necromancy isn't a crime. "
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37b_Player","A defiler? A blood-drinking Child of Sorrow?"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37c_Player","Twice-cursed defilers! They are the worst of the undead!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Player","Stay in the light! It is our only protection."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Player","Maraike will protect us. Her powers are strong against these abominations."
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11b_Kill_Default","Abomination! The light of Einar will destroy you!"
"Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11c_Kill_Default","Twice-cursed monster! Prepare to die - again!"
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4b_Cynicism_Default","Right out of a fairytale, as ugly as life."
"Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4c_Cynicism_Default","And certainly not lizardfolk."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21b_Player","So - big, walking lizards with spikes all over their backs?"
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21c_Player","Except for the one who looked just like your Captain, of course."
"Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21d_Player","Was he one of them all along, do you think?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4b_History_Default","Doesn't have the big spines…"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_10_Default","It's standing just like a human. Ever seen a dragon do that?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_11_Default","Ever seen a dragon at all? How would you know?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_12_Default","Stop losing time, it's just a statue."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_01","Look at this place! I've never seen so many books!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_02","It would take a lifetime to read them all! Even for an elf!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_03","Must be worth a fortune! If only we could get everything back to Caer Cyflen…"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_04","I see the point of the Scavengers now…"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_05","Why not keep this to ourselves?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_01","Crap! The book just turned into dust!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_02","Damn! This book is… not really here!"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_03","Do you mean all this fortune is out of reach?"
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_04","The library is trapped within this… magical phenomenon."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_05","I should have known… it was too good to be true."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_22_Religion_Default","That's an old Tirmarian symbol. It stands for Arivad."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_23_Religion_Default","He was a Tirmarian god, but he didn't come to Solasta."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_24_Religion_Default","I can't remember much more."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_25_Einar_Default","""A"" stands for Arivad - an evil god from old Tirmar. I read about him."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_26_Einar_Default","The Soraks call him Sorr-Tarr. ""Sorr-Akkath"" means ""beloved of Sorr-Tarr"" in their tongue."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_27_Lowlife_Default","I've heard whispers of cultists with an ""A"" tattoo."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_28_Lowlife_Default","There's a name, too: ""Arivad."""
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_29_Default","These humans are Arivad cultists, in league with the Soraks."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_30_Default","We better be careful."
"Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_31_Default","And don't forget, we need the head of a Sorak."
"Narration/&InTemple_1_Crowbearer_Default","Lord Sunblaze - thank you for you hospitality."
"Narration/&InTemple_2_EinarBoss_NPC","It's the least we can do for the deputies who proved that there are still Soraks on Solasta."
"Narration/&InTemple_3_EinarBoss_NPC","You've proved we cannot relax our vigilance."
"Narration/&InTemple_4_EinarBoss_NPC","Did you find anything else that could help us track them?"
"Narration/&InTemple_5_EinarBoss_NPC","There was a parchment. "
"Narration/&InTemple_6_EinarBoss_NPC","If you find it, send for the Tshar."
"Narration/&InTemple_7_Curious_NPC","You can read that?"
"Narration/&InTemple_8_EinarBoss_NPC","That last word, it's not Tirmarian… it's in the Sorr-Akkath tongue."
"Narration/&InTemple_9_Selfpres_NPC","I knew it!"
"Narration/&InTemple_10_EinarBoss_NPC","It means ""general."""
"Narration/&InTemple_11_EinarBoss_NPC","You were wise to run."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_1_Player_Default","Also, the fanatics we fought near that old tower…"
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_2_Player_Default","…they all had this tattoo on their arm."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_3_Player_Default","And we found this letter."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_4_Player_Default","It seems to support the idea that they were working for the Soraks under duress."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_5_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","It is indeed one of their ways. "
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_6_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Now this, is the A of Arivad."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_7_Player_Default","Can you enlighten us?"
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_8_Player_Default","Between the myth and what we've seen, it's confusing."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_9_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Of course."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_10_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","We paladins and clerics of Einar are the guardians of these memories."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_11_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Our ancestors fought the war against the Sorr-Akkath."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_12_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Their god, Sorr-Tarr, gave them dark powers of treachery, mind reading, and shapechanging."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_13_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","They infiltrated the human society, corrupted the hearts of men."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_14_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","At some point, everyone was suspected to be a Sorak in disguise."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_15_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Distrust broke humanity. Sorr-Tarr had won. "
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_16_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","He corrupted even Arivad, god of the inquisitors."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_17_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The gods themselves decided to run away from Tirmar."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_18_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","They opened the rift for the humans to escape, to Solasta."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_19_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Many of them didn't make it. It was a tragedy."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_20_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","At the site of the rift, thousands of Soraks tried to cross."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_21_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Sorr-Tarr himself tried."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_22_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The rift was closed, in a gigantic blast."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_23_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Our kings and heroes, Manacalon's masters of magic, were all wiped out."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_24_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","So, how could Soraks have survived, escaped and then thrived on Solasta?"
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_25_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","I supposed that's another one of their tricks."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_26_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","But for those who had survived the war, the exodus…"
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_27_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","…it was paramount to stay vigilant, to keep the memory alive."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_28_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The memory of what Soraks were, what they could do."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_29_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","So that, if one day, they were to return."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_30_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","We'd be ready."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_31_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","I'm sorry to say, after a thousand years, only few of us remain."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_32_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Most people believe Soraks are a mere legend, now."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_33_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","But you brought us proof."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_34_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The Soraks are not extinct."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_35_NO_AUDIO","Are there different Soraks?"
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_36_Player_Default","We fought different ones, do you know more?"
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_37_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The bulk of their army are foot soldiers, with poisoned spines."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_38_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","They breed a cast of albino priests, able to cast spells."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_39_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Some of them are deadly assassins - invisible, venomous."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_40_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Others are giant brutes."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_41_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The scriptures talk of elite warriors, anti-paladins."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_42_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The Shikkath."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_43_NO_AUDIO","Can they mimic people?"
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_44_Player_Default","Can they really impersonate people?"
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_45_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","It's been proven, though it's a long process."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_46_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","They used to kidnap a target, study it for weeks, sometimes months."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_47_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","One of their chosen ones would transform into a perfect duplicate."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_48_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Upon death, they would return to their original form."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_49_NO_AUDIO","Why do people follow them?"
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_50_Player_Default","How do they get people to worship them?"
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_51_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","They get into people's minds…"
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_52_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","…learn their darkest secrets, their fears, their shameful desires."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_53_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","With that, they can blackmail, corrupt, and finally recruit."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_54_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","It's much easier for them than to duplicate, and very efficient."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_55_Player_Default","Well, that's all very scary, but thanks, it's going to help us."
"Narration/&InTemple_Added_56_Player_Default","You're welcome, deputies."
"Narration/&InTemple_12_EinarBoss_NPC","If you find anything else connected to the Sorr-Akkath or their allies, bring it to the Temple."
"Narration/&InTemple_13_EinarBoss_NPC","Talk to Chaplain Dalon Lark. You will be well rewarded."
"Narration/&InTemple_14_EinarBoss_NPC","Whenever you're ready, the Council will meet again."
"Narration/&Council02_Final1_Gormdsottir_NPC","Deputies!"
"Narration/&Council02_Final2_Gormdsottir_NPC","Your report speaks of a library in a tower of magic?"
"Narration/&Council02_Final3_Any_Default","Yes, madam."
"Narration/&Council02_Final4_Gormdsottir_NPC","That is incredible! Do you realize the historical value?"
"Narration/&Council02_Final5_Any_Default","Well, all these books are either floating above a chasm or… disappear on touch."
"Narration/&Council02_Final6_Gormdsottir_NPC","What? So all this knowledge is not accessible?"
"Narration/&Council02_Final7_Any_Default","It's going to take a lot of time to check the place entirely."
"Narration/&Council02_Final8_Any_Default","And it may not be totally safe."
"Narration/&Council02_Final9_Any_Default","Scavengers are going to establish an outpost, I suppose."
"Narration/&Council02_Final10_Gormdsottir_NPC","This is an incredible finding, deputies. Thanks for your service."
"Narration/&Council02_Final11_Any_Default","You're welcome."
"Narration/&Council02_Final12_Any_Formal","Chancellor."
"Narration/&Exposition1_Beric_NPC","Four new members, all recommended by trusted citizens."
"Narration/&Exposition2_Gormsdottir_NPC","We should deputize them right away."
"Narration/&Exposition3_Beric_NPC","They will be pretty green. Let's wait for Captain Merran to return."
"Narration/&Exposition4_Gormsdottir_NPC","We can't wait. Three weeks without any news?"
"Narration/&Exposition5_Gormsdottir_NPC","Everybody in Caer Lem might be dead already."
"Narration/&Exposition6_Gormsdottir_NPC","Lord Stonebeard is eager to send troops to rescue his daughter."
"Narration/&Exposition7_Beric_NPC","Only Council forces may enter the Badlands! Otherwise, the treaty is broken, and it's war."
"Narration/&Exposition8_Gormsdottir_NPC","That's why we need to hire more Council deputies, even if they're not tested!"
"Narration/&Exposition9_Gormsdottir_NPC","Way too many people are waiting for the Council to fail!"
"Narration/&Exposition10_Gormsdottir_NPC","Oh, look, the Legacy Council doesn't work! Nobody wants to join it!"
"Narration/&Exposition11_Gormsdottir_NPC","Let's invade the principality and take the Badlands' treasures first!"
"Narration/&Exposition12_Beric_NPC","I know. The Council must hold."
"Narration/&Exposition13_Beric_NPC","Let's get our new deputies to work."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_1_Carran_NPC","Lord Carran, we'd like to ask you a few questions."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_2_Player_Default","Again?"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_3_Carran_NPC","Well, I'm here at your service, deputies."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_4_WRITTEN_A","Ask for details about the geography."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_5_WRITTEN_A1","Ask for details about the Principality."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_6_WRITTEN_A2","Ask for details about the Badlands."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_7_WRITTEN_A3","Ask for details about the Eastern Kingdoms."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_8_WRITTEN_B","Ask for details about the politics."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_9_WRITTEN_B1","Ask for details about the Council."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_10_WRITTEN_B2","Ask for details about the factions."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_11_WRITTEN_B3","Ask for details about the Scavengers."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_12_WRITTEN_ChangeTopics","Change the general topic."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_13_Player_Default","Can you explain again the Legacy Council's purpose?"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_14_Carran_NPC","Really? Right."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_15_Carran_NPC","The position of the Copperhead Road puts the Principality in a strategic position…"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_16_Carran_NPC","…to exploit the ancient knowledge and treasures that come out of the Badlands."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_17_Carran_NPC","The Council makes sure everyone has equal access, so no one's tempted to invade."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_19_Player_Default","Why are you recruiting adventurers?"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_18_Carran_NPC","To scout the Badlands and the Marches that surround them…"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_20_Carran_NPC","…and bring back whatever can be recovered. Antiquities, magical lore, anything."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_21_Carran_NPC","Then the Council makes sure everyone gets a chance to study it."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_22_Carran_NPC","We want people who will swear allegiance to the Council, and not to one nation."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_23_Carran_NPC","It's a… fresh idea. I'm afraid it hasn't had much success so far."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_24_Carran_NPC","Captain Merran is a great example for beginners."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_25_Carran_NPC","But the events in Caer Lem… well, we lost almost all of our people there."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_27_Carran_NPC","Captain Henrik's demise sends the wrong message."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_28_Carran_NPC","Lord Stonebeard, an influential member of the Snow Alliance is also very…"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_29_Carran_NPC","…doubtful about the whole concept."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_30_Carran_NPC","I thought you knew, since you're in it…"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_31_Player_Default","What can you tell us about the Scavengers?"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_32_Carran_NPC","I would say: don't be fooled by the name."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_33_Carran_NPC","Some of them were already exploring the Old Empire before the Copperhead Road…"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_34_Carran_NPC","…when it was near impossible to get through the mountains and into the Badlands."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_35_Carran_NPC","Most of them are now providing services to adventurers, and the Council."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_36_Carran_NPC","I supposed you've already met Annie Bagmordah, her leader."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_37_Carran_NPC","What factions are in play here?"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_38_Carran_NPC","The Circle of Danantar is based here in the Principality."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_39_Carran_NPC","His leader, Lord Edvan Danantar, is a renowned Spellblade master."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_40_Carran_NPC","The Guild of Antiquarians is from the Snow Alliance, to the north."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_41_Carran_NPC","They crave anything of historical value, even mundane items…"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_42_Carran_NPC","…as long as they're old enough."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_43_Carran_NPC","The Tower of Knowledge is from the Kingdom of Gallivan…"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_44_Carran_NPC","…they are academics, interested in all kinds of… well, knowledge."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_45_Carran_NPC","The Arcaneum is from the New Empire…"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_46_Carran_NPC","…magic is their passion, especially ancient, Manacalon magic."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_47_Carran_NPC","You're welcome, deputies."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_48_Carran_NPC","And… stay in the light."
"Narration/&CarranTalk_49_Carran_NPC","I'll be here to answer your questions…"
"Narration/&CarranTalk_50_Carran_NPC","…unless I'm busy with Council affairs."
"Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_01","Where are we landing this time? "
"Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_02","The lake shouldn't be dried up with such a flow coming from the river."
"Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_02","What do you think? Fight or leave?"
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_2_Self_PreservationOrSelfishness_Normal","You had to touch it!"
"Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_3_Self_PreservationOrSelfishness_Normal","Find us a way back! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_9b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","…magic came out of nowhere! Targeting us! "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_10b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","And how is that a curse? "
"Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_12b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","Who said what? "

"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary15_Mercenary_NPC","Not easy to see, in the back of the mouth."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary16_Lowlife_Default","So even if he's dead, there's money to make?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary17_Mercenary_NPC","Yep."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary18_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB_Sellsword","Let's join forces."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary19_Sellsword_Default","We should team up."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary20_Mercenary_NPC","Tomorrow maybe, I've got wounds to tend to."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary21_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC","Need some equipment?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary22_Starter_Default","Well, Galar has some good stuff, wanna check?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary23_Mercenary_NPC","Naah, I'm good."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary24_Mercenary_NPC","Sure, why not."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary25_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD","Tell us about Marin Ving"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary26_Mercenary_NPC","What do you know about Ving?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary27_Mercenary_NPC","Dunno, really. Heard stories."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary28_Mercenary_NPC","Elusive guy."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary29_Mercenary_NPC","He got debts, enemies…"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary30_Mercenary_NPC","…but everybody wants him alive."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_1_Noble_NPC","What is it?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_2_Starter_Default","Anything you need from the store?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_3_Noble_NPC","I'm not here to shop!"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_4_Starter_Default","Sorry, what are you here for?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_5_Noble_NPC","Looking for this damn Marin Ving."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_6_Noble_NPC","He was here, you may have seen him."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_7_Partner_Default","We're new, so, probably not."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_8_Noble_NPC","Well, he's a ruffian, and he has a debt of honor."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_9_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA_Aristocrat","Honor is important."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_10_Aristocrat_Default","Well, if it's a question of honor, he needs to be found."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_11_Noble_NPC","Absolutely!"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_12_Noble_NPC","I'm happy to see that this word still means something in this forsaken place."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_13_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB_ Lawkeeper","He's wanted?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_14_Lawkeeper_Default","Is he wanted by the law?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_15_Noble_NPC","Not by Principality's law."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_16_Noble_NPC","But in the Duchy of Northern plains, he surely is."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_17_Lawkeeper_Default","Well in that case, we can't remain neutral."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_18_Lawkeeper_Default","Count on us for the hunt, sir."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_19_Noble_NPC","Thank you."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_20_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC","We'll find him."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_21_Starter_Default","Alright, we will find him, don't worry."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_22_Noble_NPC","I have no doubt."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_23_Noble_Angry","You have the guts to speak to me after what  you did?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_1_Rogue_NPC","Don't even try to sell me your stuff."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_2_Starter_Default","Why not?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_3_Rogue_NPC","I know Galar is pushing the prices up because we're on the road."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_4_Starter_Default","You're in the business?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_5_Rogue_NPC","No…I joined the party hoping to find some historical treasures."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_6_NOAUDIO_Academic","There are some around here"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_7_Academic_Default","Oh, this place is full of history."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_8_Rogue_NPC","Right? Have you seen anything?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_9_Academic_Default","I'm pretty sure if we get off the road, we'll find some antiques."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_10_Rogue_NPC","Well if you do, I'm interested in buying."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_11_NOAUDIO_Acolyte","Do you pray to Misaye?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_12_Acolyte_Default","Is that a lady of luck tatoo you've got there?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_13_Rogue_NPC","Just a mercenary thing."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_14_Acolyte_Default","There's no shame in worship."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_15_Rogue_NPC","Are you done?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_16_Acolyte_Default","Scholars and Academics rarely worship the goddess of Mischief, that's all."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_17_Rogue_NPC","I wasn't always a scholar."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_18_Rogue_NPC","Otherwise I wouldn't be here."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_19_Acolyte_Default","You mean, you can fight, right?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_20_Rogue_NPC","Better than the other six who died on the way here."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_21_Rogue_NPC","Stay in the light."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_22_NOAUDIO_Defaulter","Instead you almost got killed"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_23_Any_Default","Instead you got attacked by orcs."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_24_Rogue_NPC","As you can see, I'm still standing."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_25_NOAUDIO_Deception","You'll get a rebate"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_26_Deceiver_Default","Actually, Galar offers a rebate for Council agents."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_27_Rogue_NPC","Really? Fine, I'll check out the wares."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_28_Rogue_NPC","So that it's just the regular prices? No thanks."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_1_Galar_NPC","Ah, you're here."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_2_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Master Goldentongue tells me you're good people."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_3_HeliaFairblade_NPC","As you know, I'm shorted handed with my expedition."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_4_Starter_Default","Lost six, we heard."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_5_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Unfortunate."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_6_HeliaFairblade_NPC","If you agree to join my search party, you'll get a handsome pay."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_7_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Five gold pieces a day, each."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_8_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Twenty-five upfront."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_9_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I need Marin Ving found, he once was here."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_10_HeliaFairblade_NPC","It's been a long time, but if we're thorough, we can find his tracks."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_11_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA","Alright"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_12_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB","Thirty upfront"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_13_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC","Equipment instead of gold"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_14_ChoiceA_Default","We have a deal."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_15_ChoiceB_Default","Let's settle for thirty-five gold pieces right now."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_16_ChoiceC_Default","Gold is no use to us now, we need better equipment."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_17_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Excellent."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_18_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I moved the barrier away."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_19_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I believe this is a good way to start."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_20_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I see Galar taught you well. "
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_21_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Fine, thirty-five."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_22_Starter_Default","Thanks."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_23_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Thirty, last chance."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_24_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I don't have much, but our fallen comrades left us some items."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_25_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA","Two healing potions"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_26_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB","Dust of dissapeance"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_27_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC","Basic poison"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_28_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD","Take the gold"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_29_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Considering your action…I have my doubts."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_30_HeliaFairblade_NPC","But right now, I don't have much choice."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS011_Starter_Default","Look at this."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS012_Partner_Default","Someone made a fire here."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS013_Reactor_Default","That someone wanted to take a sleep but had to go in a rush?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS014_Commentator_Default","Did you hear that?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook1_HeliaFairblade_NPC","So, what do you have for me?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook2_Starter_Angry","We found an abandoned camp."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook3_Starter_Angry","And this."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook4_HeliaFairblade_NPC","This belongs to Marin Ving."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook5_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Excellent work."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook6_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Take a rest, we'll search the area carefully in the morning."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook7_HeliaFairblade_NPC","We need to know where he went."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook8_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Team-up with my people if you like."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook9_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Master Goldentongue wants to talk to you, by the way."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook10_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I advise you to make amends."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook11_Mean_Slang","Bugger off."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook12_Anyother_Normal","We don't need a lecture."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook13_HeliaFairblade_NPC","As promised, your reward."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest1_Rogue_NPC","Looks like you brought me some."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest2_Starter_Default","Multiple items, actually, they seem connected."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest3_Rogue_NPC","By all the gods…"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest4_Rogue_NPC","Thanks a lot, this is going to make my day!"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest5_Rogue_NPC","Here, take this, I have no use for it, but maybe you will…"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_1_Player_Default","Wait…redeemers?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_2_Player_Default","We don't stand a chance!"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_3_Player_Default","Maybe we can find a way around and return to the camp."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_4_Player_Default","This place is a…nest, or something."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_5_Player_Default","We can't go back."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_6_Player_Default","Looks like our friend VIP suffered the same predicament."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_7_Player_Default","There's no choice, we have to move forward."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_Basic","Yes, yes, I'll check your wares."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_Waiting","Anything new?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_QuestDone","You did well."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_Angry","There is only one rule : don't get caught."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Basic","Sorry, I really need to catch my breath."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Waiting","Tell me if you find anything of interest."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Happy","Those artifacts you brought me are very interesting."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Basic","Those orcs almost killed us all."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Waiting","I'm sharpening my blade."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Angry","Where I come from, we cut the hands of thieves."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Basic","Speak to Lady Fairblade, I'm resting."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Waiting","Find me Ving, I'll reward you."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Angry","I knew you were just scum."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Galar_Angry","I can't have thieves working for me."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Recruit","If you're after Ving, I'm in."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Recruit","Sure, let's do this."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Recruit","Why not, I'll tag along."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions1_WRITTEN_ChoiceA","Ask companions to stay"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions2_WRITTEN_ChoiceB","Never mind."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions3_ChoiceA_Default","We'd like to continue on our own, for now."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions4_ChoiceB_Default","It's nothing, sorry."
"Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer1_Wanderer_Default","Hey TBC NPC, how are you ?"
"Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer2_HalfOrc_NPC","I need you help in there."
"Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer3_Wanderer_Default","The mine ?"
"Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer4_HalfOrc_NPC","I know who attacked our settlement, back there."
"Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer5_HalfOrc_NPC","I trapped them into a part of the mines."
"Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer6_HalfOrc_NPC","I asked the Baron, he agreed to open it for me, if you come with me."
"Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer7_Wanderer_Default","Sure, let's kill those bastards."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_1_Starter_Default","We're out!"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_2_Partner_Default","This place is a redeemer's nest!"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_3_Reactor_Default","How are we going to go back to the camp?"
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_4_Commentator_Default","We can't. "
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_5_Starter_Default","On the other hand…I think Marin Ving went that way, too."
"Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_6_Starter_Default","See?"
