"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_01","The bridge is closed for now."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_02","The Council is in the opposite direction."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_01","There's trouble on the road. Please remain in town for now."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_02","Please stay in the high town for now."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MaddyGreenisle01","Clear skies, citizens!"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_AnnieBagmordah01","We'll talk after your swearing-in."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_AnnieBagmordah02","I'll be with you in a minute."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HugoRequer01","Let's get you deputized, first, shall we?"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HugoRequer02","I'm in the middle of something - sorry!"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_GorimIronsoot01","Lord Carran said not to bother you… yet."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_GorimIronsoot02","Come back later. I'm busy with the accounts."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_KarelMartel","Lord Carran said no more beer… sorry!"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark01","I'm busy. Come back later."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark02","Oh, it's you. Well, I'm still busy. Thank you for your service."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark03","Look who's here - Caer Cyflen's rising stars!"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark04","Council business is not my business. Be on your way."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark05","We knew this war was looming. We'll prevail, as always."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton01","Go get killed in the Badlands…"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton02","You were still filling your diapers when I killed my first ghoul…"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton03","I heard your stories. Not impressive."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton04","I know everyone in this city… and everyone knows me."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton05","You're still here? I'm sure there are some rats to kill in some cave somewhere."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton06","I know that look. Something happened… something bad."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton07","Don't get too cocky. These Soraks have more tricks up their sleeves."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton08","That crown's a trouble magnet, I can tell."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton09","Still alive? Good. There's more cleaning up to do."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton10","I'm better, sure. Doesn't mean I can't have a couple of beers…"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton11","Well, I handled some unfinished business… feels good. I'm celebrating."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton12","If you're looking for a sharp blade… I'm your man."

"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant03","You want to buy something, ask Galar."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant04","No time to chat - sorry!"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CoparannKeepGuard01","Keep out, strangers!"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CoparannKeepGuard02","The Baron's waiting for you."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaptainIronshell01","Stay in the light, citizens!"
"TextOnlyPCSpeech_TowerOfMagicJammedDoor","This door is blocked… magically?"
"Banter_Generic_01","Something's off."
"Banter_Generic_02","We should search the area carefully."
"Banter_Generic_03","Look at this place!"
"Banter_Generic_04","Doesn't make any sense…"
"Banter_Caerlem_01","Where did those goblins come from?"
"Banter_Caerlem_02","Some hole in the mountain, I guess."
"Banter_Caerlem_03","What's that smell?"
"Banter_Caerlem_04","Damn, it stinks…"
"Banter_Caerlem_05","I wouldn't sleep here."
"Banter_Caerlem_06","The Soraks can't be far away."
"Banter_Caerlem_07","We need to rest if we want to stand a chance against them."
"Banter_Caerlem_08","This place is so dark…"
"Banter_Caerlem_09","That was fun."
"Banter_Caerlem_10","That was a long shot."
"Banter_Caerlem_11","We were so close."
"Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_01","I can't believe Lisbath stayed behind…"
"Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_02","We're all gonna die…"
"Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_03","I'll have to tell the captain's wife."
"Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_01","We should have left long ago…"

"Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_03","They won't get me without a fight."
"Banter_Caerlem_Robar_01","Up to my knees in the mud, nothing new here."
"Banter_Caerlem_Robar_02","Shit food, shit shoes, business as usual."
"Banter_Caerlem_Robar_03","If we survive this I might drink myself to death."
"Banter_ToM_01","This place doesn't make any sense."
"Banter_ToM_02","In the Badlands… blah, blah…"
"Banter_ToM_03","What happens if you fall down there?"
"Banter_ToM_04","Wanna try?"
"Banter_ToM_05","All these books floating around and I can't grab them."
"Banter_ToM_06","Are those webs?"
"Banter_ButlerRavensworth_01","Welcome, deputies!"
"Banter_ButlerRavensworth_02","Your rooms are ready."
"Banter_ButlerRavensworth_03","Good day, senior deputies."
"Banter_ButlerRavensworth_04","Clear skies… as they say!"
"Banter_BoneKeep_01","This place is so… wet."
"Banter_BoneKeep_02","Feels like everything's dead around here…"
"Banter_BoneKeep_03","Well, it's dark, but at least it's not sewers anymore."
"Banter_BoneKeep_04","Stay on your guard! We weren't invited here."
"Banter_BoneKeep_05","What's in all those bottles?"
"Banter_BoneKeep_06","I wouldn't set them on fire just to find out."
"Banter_BoneKeep_07","Smells like death."
"Banter_BoneKeep_08","Is that a… pile of corpses? Gross!"
"Banter_BoneKeep_09","Someone here doesn't like the light of day."
"Banter_BoneKeep_10","What kind of castle is that?"
"Banter_BoneKeep_11","Someone transformed it into a maze."
"Banter_BoneKeep_12","Someone paranoid, you mean?"
"Banter_BoneKeep_13","We're going to die here."
"Banter_BoneKeep_14","There must a way be out."
"Banter_BoneKeep_15","Look for hints!"
"Banter_BoneKeep_16","It lost its mana, that's all."
"Banter_BoneKeep_17","These arrows, they're not just random."
"Banter_BoneKeep_18","Something's changed here."
"Banter_BoneKeep_19","That cannot be opened from here."
"Banter_BoneKeep_20","There must be a mechanism somewhere."
"Banter_BoneKeep_21","I heard a mechanism."
"Banter_BoneKeep_22","That opened something."
"Banter_BoneKeep_23","This guy made it this far… maybe he found a hint."
"Banter_BoneKeep_24","Another victim of the maze…"
"Banter_BoneKeep_25","Tell me we're not going back in there…"
"Banter_BoneKeep_26","So, no rune activated on that teleporter."
"Banter_BoneKeep_27","I guess we need to reset the teleporter."
"Banter_BoneKeep_28","I think we took a wrong turn."
"Banter_BoneKeep_29","Hmm… four slabs for the four of us?"
"Banter_BoneKeep_30","And… no rune on that teleporter, either."
"Banter_BoneKeep_31","I think this slab has triggered something!"
"Banter_BoneKeep_32","I heard some kind of mechanism!"
"Banter_BoneKeep_Talbut","Keep away from my home, strangers!"
"Banter_BoneKeep_Anbgi","Where's that damn femur?"
"Banter_Abjuration_01","She's crazy…"
"Banter_Abjuration_02","Shouldn't we go to Coparann?"
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_01","My beautiful river… broken and stained…"
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_02","The pull, the pull…"
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_03","Master, I'm coming!"
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_04","Are there dwarf kings now? Halfling kings too, maybe?"
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_05","That sounds… wrong."
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_06","No slaves, no Gates…"
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_07","…this travel is exhausting."
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_08","Humans don't look that bad."
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_09","They smell a bit, though…"
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_10","This… town is really dirty."
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_11","Is this Baron really a dwarf?"
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_12","I can't call a dwarf my lord, can I?"
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_13","He's rude. But he is a dwarf, after all."
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_14","He is a nice dwarf."
"Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_15","A halfling merchant? I almost didn't see him."
"Banter_Cyflen_01","Nice gardens."
"Banter_Cyflen_02","This place is magnificent."
"Banter_Cyflen_03","I never thought I'd get so close to the embassies."
"Banter_Cyflen_04","That's a view!"
"LoreTrailer01","Before the Cataclysm, there were no gods on Solasta."
"LoreTrailer02","No humans, either."
"LoreTrailer03","Then the Rift opened."
"LoreTrailer04","Some say it was a magical accident… "
"LoreTrailer05","…or the work of an evil god."
"LoreTrailer06","No one knows for sure."
"LoreTrailer07","The Cataclysm destroyed the old High Elf empire"
"LoreTrailer08","- Manacalon, they called it -"
"LoreTrailer09","and twisted the land beyond recognition."
"LoreTrailer10","Now, only the brave and the foolish go there, in search of ancient treasures."
"LoreTrailer11","But something is happening, deep in those Badlands."
"LoreTrailer12","Whatever it is,"
"LoreTrailer13","it can't be good."
"TelemaArrivingTitle","Entering Telema"
"Telema_1_Entrance_Fighter","So, these are the ruins of Telema?"
"Telema_2_Entrance_Wizard","Just as the chronicles describe them!"
"Telema_3_Entrance_Wizard","Imagine the wonders that await us inside!"
"Telema_4_Entrance_Cleric","Don't forget… we're here to help the Scavengers."
"Telema_5_Entrance_Rogue","And get rich, right?"
"Telema_6_Entrance_Rogue","Help the Scavengers and get rich."
"Telema_7_Entrance_Fighter","You're all heart, aren't you?"
"Telema_8_Entrance_Cleric","That must be their camp over there."
"Telema_9_Entrance_Cleric","Come on, let's go."
"TelemaMeetingScavsTitle","The Scavengers' Camp"
"Telema_10_MeetingScavs_Lena","Who goes there?"
"Telema_11_MeetingScavs_Fighter","Friends!"
"Telema_12_MeetingScavs_Cleric","Runnel sent us."
"Telema_13_MeetingScavs_Dek","Where is he?"
"Telema_14_MeetingScavs_Cleric","Resting… he was in pretty bad shape, but he'll be okay."
"Telema_15_MeetingScavs_Cleric","He said you need help."
"Telema_16_MeetingScavs_Dek","We did. If only you'd come sooner…"
"Telema_17_MeetingScavs_Choice","What happened?"
"Telema_18_MeetingScavs_Answer","We came as soon as we could. What happened?"
"Telema_19_MeetingScavs_Lena","We know… and thanks."
"Telema_20_MeetingScavs_Lena","Dek here is upset, that's all."
"Telema_21_MeetingScavs_Dek","I can speak for myself, thank you!"
"Telema_22_MeetingScavs_Lena","He thinks we should have left with Runnel."
"Telema_23_MeetingScavs_Dek","Instead of waiting here for the orcs to kill us?"
"Telema_24_MeetingScavs_Dek","Absolutely, I think we should have left!"
"Telema_25_MeetingScavs_Choice","We're here now."
"Telema_26_MeetingScavs_Answer","Well, we're here now. How can we help?"
"Telema_27_MeetingScavs_Lena","Never mind Dek."
"Telema_28_MeetingScavs_Lena","He's upset, that's all."
"Telema_29_MeetingScavs_Dek","I can speak for myself, thank you!"
"Telema_30_MeetingScavs_Lena","He thinks we should have left with Runnel."
"Telema_31_MeetingScavs_Dek","Instead of waiting for the orcs to kill us?"
"Telema_32_MeetingScavs_Dek","Absolutely, I think we should have left!"
"Telema_33_MeetingScavs_Choice","We could go back."
"Telema_34_MeetingScavs_Answer","Well, if we're too late, maybe we should just go back."
"Telema_35_MeetingScavs_Dek","Yes, well, maybe you should!"
"Telema_36_MeetingScavs_Lena","Never mind Dek."
"Telema_37_MeetingScavs_Lena","He's upset, that's all."
"Telema_38_MeetingScavs_Dek","Upset? Why should I be upset? We're just waiting to die, that's all!"
"Telema_39_MeetingScavs_Lena","We can't leave Hector in there."
"Telema_40_MeetingScavs_Dek","He's dead, Lena… dead! It's too late!"
"Telema_41_MeetingScavs_Lena","You don't know that!"
"Telema_42_MeetingScavs_Choice","Calm down."
"Telema_43_MeetingScavs_Answer","Calm down, now. This won't help."
"Telema_44_MeetingScavs_Choice","We'll help you."
"Telema_45_MeetingScavs_Answer","It's all right… we're here to help you."
"Telema_46_MeetingScavs_Choice","Amazing."
"Telema_47_MeetingScavs_Answer","Why don't you just kill each other and save the orcs the trouble?"
"Telema_48_MeetingScavs_Rogue","What's our help worth to you, anyway?"
"Telema_49_MeetingScavs_Fighter","Stop it!"
"Telema_50_MeetingScavs_Lena","All right."
"Telema_51_MeetingScavs_Lena","What did Runnel tell you?"
"Telema_52_MeetingScavs_Fighter","Just that his team needed help… nothing else."
"Telema_53_MeetingScavs_Lena","We were scavenging in the ruins, and -"
"Telema_54_MeetingScavs_Dek","Orcs! There's a whole tribe in there!"
"Telema_55_MeetingScavs_Lena","It was just a raiding party."
"Telema_56_MeetingScavs_Lena","We fought them off… "
"Telema_57_MeetingScavs_Lena","…but they killed some of our people and dragged Hector off."
"Telema_58_MeetingScavs_Dek","And we've just been waiting here for them to come and finish the job."
"Telema_59_MeetingScavs_Fighter","They haven't done that yet, though."
"Telema_60_MeetingScavs_Rogue","Well, you're right about your friend… "
"Telema_61_MeetingScavs_Rogue","…he must be dead by now."
"Telema_62_MeetingScavs_Cleric","We don't know that. There is always hope."
"Telema_63_MeetingScavs_Rogue","Hope? Those orcs had him for dinner the first night."
"Telema_64_MeetingScavs_Wizard","I don't know… they took him alive, after all…"
"Telema_65_MeetingScavs_Rogue","So they wanted to keep him fresh… orcs are orcs!"
"Telema_66_MeetingScavs_Fighter","Ignore them. So, we just need to go in and find Hector?"
"Telema_67_MeetingScavs_Dek","Yeah… good luck with that!"
"Telema_68_MeetingScavs_Cleric","Why is he so angry?"
"Telema_69_MeetingScavs_Lena","He and Hector don't exactly get along."
"Telema_70_MeetingScavs_Lena","But he's one of our crew… "
"Telema_71_MeetingScavs_Lena","…and I won't leave anyone behind."
"Telema_72_MeetingScavs_Cleric","We gave our word to your leaders."
"Telema_73_MeetingScavs_Cleric","We will get Hector back."
"Telema_74_MeetingScavs_Lena","Thanks."
"Telema_75_MeetingScavs_Lena","Do you need food?"
"Telema_76_MeetingScavs_Fighter","You think we'll be away for that long?"
"Telema_77_MeetingScavs_Lena","You can never be too careful… "
"Telema_78_MeetingScavs_Lena","…that's the law of the Badlands."
"Telema_79_MeetingScavs_Lena","We can spare some if you need it."
"Telema_80_MeetingScavs_Lena","We have more than we need for just the two of us."
"Telema_81_MeetingScavs_Dek","Are you serious?"
"Telema_82_MeetingScavs_Dek","You're giving away our food?"
"Telema_83_MeetingScavs_Lena","They're risking their lives for us, Dek."
"Telema_84_MeetingScavs_Dek","For Hector. We can starve, apparently."
"Telema_85_MeetingScavs_ChoiceIntimidate","The rescuers get the food."
"Telema_86_MeetingScavs_AnswerIntimidate","The rescuers get the food."
"Telema_87_MeetingScavs_Fighter","Get it?"
"Telema_88_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","I don't believe it."
"Telema_89_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","That's on you, Lena."
"Telema_90_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess","Don't worry,"

"Telema_94_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed","Nice try."
"Telema_95_MeetingScavs_Fightercheckfailed","Shut up."
"Telema_96_MeetingScavs_Fighter","We should get moving and find your friend."
"Telema_97_MeetingScavs_Lena","Thanks!"
"Telema_98_MeetingScavs_Lena","And good luck!"
"Telema_99_MeetingScavs_ChoicePersuasion","You're right… keep your food."
"Telema_100_MeetingScavs_AnswerPersuasion","You're right… keep it. We'll survive."
"Telema_101_MeetingScavs_Cleric","We'll be back in no time."
"Telema_102_MeetingScavs_Cleric","If not, you'll have enough to eat."
"Telema_103_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","Don't look at me."
"Telema_104_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess","Just one day of food, Dek."
"Telema_105_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","All right, take the damn food!"
"Telema_106_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","Thank you!"
"Telema_107_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed","Absolutely."
"Telema_108_MeetingScavs_Choice","Your boss said you'd feed us."
"Telema_109_MeetingScavs_Answer","Your boss said we could take whatever resources we needed."
"Telema_110_MeetingScavs_Dek","Did he?"
"Telema_111_MeetingScavs_Rogue","Are you calling me a liar?"
"Telema_112_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","No."
"Telema_113_MeetingScavs_Deceptionchecksuccess","So?"
"Telema_114_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess","So take the damn food!"
"Telema_115_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed","Why not?"
"Telema_116_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed","Fair enough."
"Telema_117_MeetingScavs_Wizardcheckfailed","Impressive negotiation skills."

"TelemaBasReliefTitle","A Sight for Sore Eyes"
"Telema_119_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard","Look at that!"
"Telema_120_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard","Perfectly preserved!"
"Telema_121_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric","What is it?"
"Telema_122_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard","It's a scene from the Imperial conquest of the northern provinces."
"Telema_123_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric","When the Empire ruled the lands of the Snow Alliance."
"Telema_124_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric","I can't pretend to feel nostalgic about those times."
"Telema_125_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard","Nostalgic? That was more than a thousand years ago!"
"Telema_126_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric","The Old Empire was built on slavery and racism."
"Telema_127_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue","Thanks for the (yawn) history lesson."
"Telema_128_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue","Now… does this look valuable to you?"
"Telema_129_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard","All history is valuable, my friend."
"Telema_130_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue","Tell that to my purse."
"Telema_131_Room01_BasRelief_Fighter","Anyway, this doesn't help Hector, so let's move out."
"TelemaChestTitle","Too Good to Be True"
"Telema_132_Room01_Chest_Fighter","Well, that's interesting."
"Telema_133_Room01_Chest_Rogue","You don't say! Look at that!"
"Telema_134_Room01_Chest_Fighter","I'd be careful if I were you."
"Telema_135_Room01_Chest_Fighter","It looks too good to be true."
"Telema_136_Room01_Chest_Rogue","That's right. You can't be too careful… "
"Telema_137_Room01_Chest_Rogue","…that's the law of the Badlands."
"TelemaStatueTitle","Memory of the Past"
"Telema_138_Room01_Statue_Rogue","Try not to stare… you're making that statue uncomfortable."
"Telema_139_Room01_Statue_Wizard","But it's… can you read this?"
"Telema_140_Room01_Statue_Rogue","Never had the benefit of an Imperial indoctrin… I mean, education."
"Telema_141_Room01_Statue_Cleric","That's Emperor Gildean the Third."
"Telema_142_Room01_Statue_Rogue","How do you know?"
"Telema_143_Room01_Statue_Cleric","It's written here."
"Telema_144_Room01_Statue_Cleric","For those who can read it."
"Telema_145_Room01_Statue_Rogue","That's nice for you, I'm sure."
"Telema_146_Room01_Statue_Wizard","His was a very ancient dynasty."
"Telema_147_Room01_Statue_Wizard","Look at his date of birth."
"Telema_148_Room01_Statue_Cleric","And location."
"Telema_149_Room01_Statue_Wizard","Wait! I must copy this."
"Telema_150_Room01_Statue_Wizard","The Tower will find this interesting."
"Telema_151_Room01_Statue_Fighter","Are you done?"
"TelemaDoorTitle","Dead End?"
"Telema_152_Room01_Door_Rogue","Can we open it?"
"Telema_153_Room01_Door_Fighter","I don't see how."
"Telema_154_Room01_Door_Wizard","Must be magically sealed."
"Telema_155_Room01_Door_Cleric","Do you think a magic seal from Imperial times would still work?"
"Telema_156_Room01_Door_Fighter","In the Badlands, anything's possible."
"Telema_157_Room01_Door_Rogue","Do you have a spell to open it?"
"Telema_158_Room01_Door_Wizard","No."
"Telema_159_Room01_Door_Fighter","Let's not waste time, then. Move out!"
"Telema_160_Room01_Crawl_Rogue","They must have gone through here after they took Hector."
"Telema_161_Room01_Crawl_Cleric","Really? We need to crawl through there?"
"Telema_162_Room01_Crawl_Rogue","Yeah, but you don't mind being on your knees, do you?"
"Telema_163_Room01_Crawl_Cleric","Very funny."
"Telema_164_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter","I see light ahead!"
"Telema_165_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue","Let me take a look before you go clanking around in your armor."
"Telema_166_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter","Be careful!"
"Telema_167_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue","Law of the Badlands, my friend."
"TelemaBackFromReconTitle","Meeting the Locals"
"Telema_168_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue","The orcs are here."

"Telema_170_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter","Even me?"
"Telema_171_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue","Ehh… probably."
"Telema_172_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric","Did you see Hector?"
"Telema_173_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue","Not a trace."
"Telema_174_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter","We should attack… we have the element of surprise."
"Telema_175_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric","But what if Hector's down there too?"
"Telema_176_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Wizard","I hear some orc tribes can be bartered with."
"Telema_177_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue","Not these orcs."
"TelemaOrcCampExitTitle","Disappointment…"
"Telema_178_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter","So, no Hector?"
"Telema_179_OrcCamp_exit_Wizard","It doesn't make any sense."
"Telema_180_OrcCamp_exit_Cleric","Maybe he's farther down."
"Telema_181_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter","All right, let's keep looking."
"TelemaVerticalEntranceTitle","Lighting the Darkness"
"Telema_182_Vertical_entrance_Fighter","I don't like this."
"Telema_183_Vertical_entrance_Rogue","We can climb down."
"Telema_184_Vertical_entrance_Wizard","It's too dark."
"Telema_185_Vertical_entrance_Cleric","Too unstable, too. These blocks look like they could fall at any minute."
"Telema_186_Vertical_entrance_Wizard","There's some kind of black oil dripping from the ceiling."
"Telema_187_Vertical_entrance_Wizard","Maybe we can use it to light up the place."
"TelemaVerticalExitTitle","No Way Back"
"Telema_188_Vertical_exit_Rogue","Damn it! Now we're stuck!"
"Telema_189_Vertical_exit_Fighter","Do you think the orcs would bring Hector farther in than this?"
"Telema_190_Vertical_exit_Wizard","Not the orcs, no… "
"Telema_191_Vertical_exit_Wizard","…but something else… maybe."
"Telema_192_Vertical_exit_Fighter","We've come this far… let's find him."
"Telema_193_Vertical_exit_Rogue","I'm starting to think we might need that food after all."
"TelemaShaftEntranceTitle","Unexpected Denizens"
"Telema_194_Shaft_entrance_Cleric","What is this… an amphitheater?"
"Telema_195_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","A very special one."
"Telema_196_Shaft_entrance_Rogue","Not room for much of a crowd…"
"Telema_197_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","Students of magic. The Masters taught spells here."
"Telema_198_Shaft_entrance_Fighter","Do spiders like magic shows?"
"Telema_199_Shaft_entrance_Fighter","Because I see a lot of webs."
"Telema_200_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","Deep spiders. We will have to be careful."
"Telema_201_Shaft_entrance_Fighter","Deep Spiders?"
"Telema_202_Shaft_entrance_Cleric","Very large and aggressive, but sensitive to light."
"Telema_203_Shaft_entrance_Rogue","Just how large is very large?"
"Telema_204_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","Just keep your lights ready…"
"Telema_205_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","…and your oil handy."
"Telema_206_Shaft_entrance_Wizard","The more light we have, the fewer spiders we'll face."
"Telema_207_Shaft_entrance_Fighter","We don't have a choice here. The only way out is up."
"TelemaShaftUpperTitle","A Way Out?"
"Telema_208_Shaft_upper_Fighter","How many are there?"
"Telema_209_Shaft_upper_Rogue","You don't want to know."
"Telema_210_Shaft_upper_Cleric","Try pushing this down!"
"Telema_211_Shaft_upper_Cleric","I feel a weakness here."
"TelemaShaftCollapsedTitle","Escape… to Hector!"
"Telema_212_Shaft_collapsed_Wizard","Well done!"
"Telema_213_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue","You sure they're dead?"
"Telema_214_Shaft_collapsed_Fighter","Well, they're not coming back."
"Telema_215_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue","Good."
"Telema_216_Shaft_collapsed_Cleric","My friends, I believe I have found Hector."
"Telema_217_Rescue_Hector","By all the gods at once… thank you!"
"Telema_218_Rescue_Fighter","Are you Hector?"
"Telema_219_Rescue_Hector","Yes! And you?"
"Telema_220_Rescue_Fighter","The boss sent us. Runnel went for help."
"Telema_221_Rescue_Hector","Runnel! So he survived?"
"Telema_222_Rescue_Cleric","Barely, but yes."
"Telema_223_Rescue_Cleric","He's safely back in town."
"Telema_224_Rescue_Rogue","So, did the spiders take you?"
"Telema_225_Rescue_Hector","The orcs did, after their raid."
"Telema_226_Rescue_Hector","They kept me for a while."
"Telema_227_Rescue_Hector","I was wondering why."
"Telema_228_Rescue_Hector","I finally got the answer when they… "
"Telema_229_Rescue_Hector","…well, they sacrificed me."
"Telema_230_Rescue_Fighter","What?"
"Telema_231_Rescue_Hector","They feed the spiders. So they don't get eaten themselves."
"Telema_232_Rescue_Hector","They leave captives at the top of the amphitheater."
"Telema_233_Rescue_Rogue","Oh, that one?"
"Telema_234_Rescue_Rogue","We kind of… destroyed it."
"Telema_235_Rescue_Fighter","The spider nest, too."
"Telema_236_Rescue_Hector","Interesting."
"Telema_237_Rescue_Hector","I'm not sure how the orcs will react to that."
"Telema_238_Rescue_Hector","This spider cult seemed important to them."
"Telema_239_Rescue_Fighter","Can't say I feel sorry for them."
"Telema_240_Rescue_Hector","I owe you my life. Thanks again."
"Telema_241_Rescue_Cleric","You are most welcome."
"Telema_242_Rescue_Fighter","You should rest, and I think we should do the same."
"Telema_243_Rescue_Hector","Good idea."
"Telema_244_Rescue_Choice","What's your story?"
"Telema_245_Rescue_Answer","So Hector, what's your story?"
"Telema_246_Rescue_Hector","Me? I'm just another Scavenger, really."
"Telema_247_Rescue_Hector","I make a living bringing old stuff out of the Badlands."
"Telema_248_Rescue_Choice","What about Lena and Dek?"
"Telema_249_Rescue_Answer","Do you know Lena and Dek? They seem like quite a pair!"
"Telema_250_Rescue_Hector","Oh, those two… always fighting over something."
"Telema_251_Rescue_Hector","But you couldn't separate them if you wanted to."
"Telema_252_Rescue_Fighter","They seemed pretty much at each other's throats."
"Telema_253_Rescue_Hector","Yeah, like I said… always fighting."
"Telema_254_Rescue_Hector","But in battle, always back to back."
"Telema_255_Rescue_Rogue","Aww… that's so sweet."
"Telema_256_Rescue_Choice","Did you find anything good in here?"
"Telema_257_Rescue_Answer","Did you find anything good in the ruins?"
"Telema_258_Rescue_Hector","No, not much. You've seen the state of the place… "
"Telema_259_Rescue_Hector","…but there was something."
"Telema_260_Rescue_Hector","Didn't have time to use it."
"Telema_261_Rescue_Fighter","What is it?"
"Telema_262_Rescue_Rogue","A key?"
"Telema_263_Rescue_Hector","I think it opens the door in the ruins."
"Telema_264_Rescue_Rogue","Oh, yeah… that door."
"Telema_265_Rescue_Hector","At least, I hope it does."
"Telema_266_Rescue_Hector","Not much else, though. I think the orcs got it all."
"Telema_267_Rescue_Choice","You're a cleric of Einar?"
"Telema_268_Rescue_Answer","You're wearing the flaming sword."
"Telema_269_Rescue_Hector","And I can see you're from the Order of the Beacon."
"Telema_270_Rescue_Cleric","Are you a priest, Hector?"
"Telema_271_Rescue_Hector","Just a humble follower."
"Telema_272_Rescue_Hector","This was given to me by one of your brothers."
"Telema_273_Rescue_Hector","We fought together… he felt like he owed me."
"Telema_274_Rescue_Hector","And he gave me this."
"Telema_275_After_Rest_Fighter","I think we're all ready to go."
"Telema_276_After_Rest_Wizard","Indeed."
"Telema_277_After_Rest_Cleric","I think we're close to the surface."
"Telema_278_After_Rest_Cleric","I can feel it."
"Telema_279_After_Rest_Fighter","All right… let's move."
"Telema_280_Ambush_Fighter","Orcs! Over there!"
"Telema_281_Ambush_Rogue","It's an ambush!"
"Telema_282_Ambush_Fighter","Time to fight!"
"Telema_283_WayBack_Fighter","Hey! Take a look at this."
"Telema_284_WayBack_Cleric","The stone is carved."
"Telema_285_WayBack_Fighter","Are we back near the ruins?"
"Telema_286_WayBack_Cleric","It looks fragile, let's try pushing it."
"Telema_287_WayBack_Fighter","Well done… we're back in the ruins!"
"Telema_288_WayBack_Rogue","So, do you still have that key?"
"Telema_289_WayBack_Hector","Sure."
"Telema_290_WayBack_Hector","Take it."
"Telema_291_Magic_Door_Wizard","Amazing!"
"Telema_292_Magic_Door_Wizard","This room hasn't been opened in a millennium!"
"Telema_293_Magic_Door_Cleric","Those books are falling to pieces."
"Telema_294_Magic_Door_Wizard","Not this one!"
"Telema_295_Magic_Door_Cleric","Look around for other valuables."
"Telema_296_Magic_Door_Rogue","Already doing it!"
"Telema_297_Exit_Temple_Lena","Hey! Here they are!"
"Telema_298_Exit_Temple_Dek","I'll be damned… they're alive!"
"Telema_299_Exit_Temple_Fighter","We told you we'd find him."
"Telema_300_Exit_Temple_Lena","Hector?"
"Telema_301_Exit_Temple_Dek","Lena, wait!"
"Telema_302_Exit_Temple_Cleric","What's going on?"
"Telema_303_Exit_Temple_Lena","That's not Hector!"
"Telema_304_Exit_Temple_Fighter","What?"
"Telema_305_Exit_Temple_Rogue","Then just who are you, friend?"
"Telema_306_Exit_Temple_Hector","Put down your weapons."
"Telema_307_Exit_Temple_Fighter","Why would we do that?"
"Tavern_01_1_Stealth_Normal","This beer tastes like donkey piss. Not that I'm complaining."
"Tavern_01_2_Explorer_Default","Hope I'm not too late."
"Tavern_01_3_Explorer_Normal","Ran into a bit of trouble on the way here."
"Tavern_01_4_Spellcaster_Normal","Take the load off. There's plenty of donkey piss to go around. "
"Tavern_01_5_Spellcaster_Formal","Sit. Relax. Perhaps you'd enjoy a pint of this obnoxious ale?"
"Tavern_01_6_Fighter_Default","Here for the Council job? Join the club. "
"Tavern_01_7_Fighter_Authoritative","If you're here for the Council job, get in line."
"Tavern_01_8_Fighter_Friendly","You're not too late, friend. We're all here for the same reason. "
"Tavern_01_9_Fighter_Default","Apparently, Lord Carran likes to keep people waiting."
"Tavern_01_10_Fighter_Authoritative","Though if this Lord Carran doesn't show up soon, I may go looking for him."
"Tavern_01_11_Fighter_Friendly","Grab a chair. "
"Tavern_01_12_Stealth_Default","Another round, barkeeper. Four of your finest flagons of donkey piss, please!"
"Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Default","Looks like you've been waiting here a while."
"Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Formal","I see you're all making the best of this."
"Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Slang","So is this the job? Getting shitfaced?"
"Tavern_01_14_Spellcaster_Normal","We do what we have to. So what's this trouble you were telling us about?"
"Tavern_01_15_Spellcaster_Formal","Indeed. You mentioned something about some trouble. Would you care to elaborate?"
"Tavern_01_16_Explorer_Normal","Well, I was making my way here… "
"Tavern_01_17_Explorer_Normal","…when three bandits leapt out of the bushes with crossbows. "
"Tavern_01_18_Explorer_Normal","They dragged me off to some decrepit prison… "
"Tavern_01_19_Explorer_Normal","…and tossed me in a filthy cell that smelled of rat piss."
"Tavern_01_20_Explorer_Slang","Well, I was heading down a lonely road… "
"Tavern_01_21_Explorer_Slang","…when three shitheads jumped from the bushes, dragged me off… "
"Tavern_01_22_Explorer_Slang","…and threw my ass in this rundown jail."
"Tavern_01_23_Explorer_Slang","Smelled like some poor bastard had died in there."
"Tavern_01_24_Explorer_Formal","I was heading down the highway, minding my own business…"
"Tavern_01_25_Explorer_Formal","…when three brigands burst out of the bushes and waylaid me."
"Tavern_01_26_Explorer_Formal","They carried me off to some ramshackle prison."
"Tavern_01_27_Explorer_Formal","An Imperial ruin of some sort… "
"Tavern_01_28_Explorer_Formal","Fortunately, the walls were as weak as this mediocre ale we're drinking."
"Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Normal","…Don't know what was holding the place up… "
"Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Slang","…a strong wind coulda taken it down."
"Tavern_02_1_Fighter_Normal","Nice move, that trick with the wall. Glad you're no worse for wear."
"Tavern_02_2_Fighter_Formal","So you escaped unscathed. Well done, my friend!"
"Tavern_02_3_Explorer_Normal","My flagon is empty of ale, and Lord Carran still isn't here."
"Tavern_02_4_Explorer_Cynical","Perhaps someone else can tell a story since it looks like we might be here a while. "
"Tavern_02_5_Explorer_Lawful","This Council needs to get organized. They have no right to keep us waiting like this. "
"Tavern_02_6_Spellcaster_Normal","Have another ale. It's not like you have anywhere better to be."
"Tavern_02_7_Spellcaster_Greedy","I don't mind waiting as long as they pay us for our darned time. "
"Tavern_02_8_Spellcaster_Aristocrat","The Council is likely busy with important matters of state, and we are not, so have patience."
"Tavern_02_9_Spellcaster_Lowlife","You think the Council cares about the likes of us? They'll get to us when they're good and ready."
"Tavern_02_10_Fighter_Normal","Well, let me tell you my story then. I, too, was accosted on the way here, but I faced my foes head on. "
"Tavern_02_11_Fighter_Violent","I have a tale to tell as well. I, too, was attacked, but I put an end to my enemies with blood and pain."
"Tavern_02_12_Stealth_Slang","So what are you waiting for? Spit it out, why don't you?"
"Tavern_02_13_Stealth_Normal","Let's hear it, then. Don't be shy."
"Tavern_02_14_Stealth_Formal","Proceed, then. Everyone enjoys a tale well told."
"Tavern_02_15_Merton_Default","What a bunch namby-pambies! You're lucky you weren't attacked by Soraks!"
"Tavern_02_16_Fighter_Normal","I don't remember anyone asking your opinion."
"Tavern_02_17_Fighter_Violent","Shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for ya!"
"Tavern_02_18_Fighter_Friendly","That's right, buddy. It's always good to be lucky."
"Tavern_02_19_Merton_Default","The Badlands are thick with 'em. Shapeshifting bastards!"
"Tavern_02_20_Stealth_Normal","Never mind him. He's just another drunk Scavenger."
"Tavern_02_21_Stealth_Cynical","Everyone's a critic."
"Tavern_02_22_Stealth_Einar","I'm so tired of stupid drunks ranting about mythical creatures."
"Tavern_02_23_Explorer_Default","Aren't all drunks basically stupid?"
"Tavern_02_24_Spellcaster_Default","Soraks might be legend, but orcs are quite real, and not just in the Badlands."
"Tavern_02_25_Spellcaster_Default","…I stumbled across a secret settlement right here in the Principality."
"Tavern_02_26_Fighter_Normal","What?"
"Tavern_02_27_Fighter_Slang","Bullshit!"
"Tavern_02_28_Fighter_Formal","That is preposterous."
"Tavern_02_29_Spellcaster_Normal","High in the hills, two days west of here."
"Tavern_02_30_Spellcaster_Normal","I left the main road to find a shorter way through… "
"Tavern_02_31_Spellcaster_Normal","And I was making good time… "
"Tavern_02_32_Spellcaster_Normal","…when I dropped through a frickin' sinkhole into a cave."
"Tavern_02_33_Spellcaster_Slang","I was dragging my weary ass up the hills west of here… "
"Tavern_02_34_Spellcaster_Slang","…and decided to leave the road to look for a shortcut."
"Tavern_02_35_Spellcaster_Slang","It was beautiful day. Blue skies. Birds singing. I watched one take wing… "
"Tavern_02_36_Spellcaster_Slang","…and fell right into a blasted hole."
"Tavern_02_37_Spellcaster_Formal","I traveled here from the east, and left the main highway… "
"Tavern_02_38_Spellcaster_Formal","…hoping to save time by traversing the hills."
"Tavern_02_39_Spellcaster_Formal","The views were magnificent, but I should have kept my eye on the path."
"Tavern_02_40_Spellcaster_Formal","Because it gave way beneath my feet, plunging me into gloomy darkness. "
"Tavern_03_1_Fighter_Selfpres","Not sure I would have slept so close to a horde of orcs."
"Tavern_03_2_Fighter_Violence","I would have slaughtered every one of those green-skinned monsters."
"Tavern_03_3_Fighter_Cynical","You slept with a bunch of orcs? That explains the smell."
"Tavern_03_4_Spellcaster_Default","Orcs have a very distinctive stink."
"Tavern_03_5_Stealth_Cynical","I'm beginning to think Lord Carran might be a mythical creature. "
"Tavern_03_6_Stealth_Violence","If Lord Carran keeps us waiting much longer, I might greet him with a dagger."
"Tavern_03_7_Stealth_Lawful","We should bill the Council for all this wasted time."
"Tavern_03_8_Explorer_Default","We've all told a tale of our travels here. All but one of us."
"Tavern_03_9_Stealth_Default","Yes, but I have a good reason for that. It's none of your damn business."
"Tavern_03_10_Fighter_Slang","Come on, now. Don't be a killjoy. We all sang for our supper. Now it's your turn!"
"Tavern_03_11_Fighter_Formal","We can't take up arms together if we don't trust each other. "
"Tavern_03_12_Fighter_Normal","You can't have a true friendship without trust. What are you hiding?"
"Tavern_03_13_Stealth_Default","Fine - you want to know the truth?"
"Tavern_03_14_Stealth_Default","I stopped on the way here to visit an old friend of mine… "
"Tavern_03_15_Stealth_Default","And discovered he was up to his eyeballs in debt with a loan shark."
"Tavern_03_16_Explorer_Normal","Oh, that's not good."
"Tavern_03_17_Explorer_Slang","Sounds like an idiot."
"Tavern_03_18_Explorer_Formal","So he was in dire straits?"
"Tavern_03_19_Stealth_Default","Indeed. He put up a family heirloom as collateral and wanted me to reacquire it."
"Tavern_03_20_Stealth_Default","Because, you see, I can be quite stealthy when necessary. "
"Tavern_041_Carran_NPC","Are you four here to see Lord Carran?"
"Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical_WRITTEN","We're not here to get drunk."
"Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","Who's asking?"
"Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence_WRITTEN","Maybe we're here looking for a fight."
"Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical","Well, we're not here to drink ourselves to death."
"Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic","Depends on who's asking."
"Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence","Maybe. Or maybe we're here just to raise hell and break heads."
"Tavern_045_Carran_cynical_NPC","Well, thank you for making that clear…"
"Tavern_045_Carran_violent_NPC","A fight, is it? I'm sure we can find an outlet for your… enthusiasm."
"Tavern_045_Carran_NPC","Well, if you are here for Lord Carran of the Legacy Council, that would be me."
"Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical_WRITTEN","So you're real, then?"
"Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful_WRITTEN","We're ready."
"Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy_WRITTEN","We should get paid for waiting."
"Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical","So you're not a mythical creature after all."
"Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful","Then we are here at your service, sir."
"Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy","Fine. I'd like to present you with a bill for the time we just spent cooling our heels."
"Tavern_049_Carran_Cynical","Unlike, say, a sober adventurer?"
"Tavern_049_Carran_Lawful","Very good."
"Tavern_049_Carran_Greedy","Feel free. The Council's bursary enjoys a good laugh."
"Tavern_049_01_Authority_Formal","Might we ask a bit more about this quest of yours, sir, if you please?"
"Tavern_049_01_Authority_Normal","Can you tell us more about the job?"
"Tavern_049_01_Authority_Slang","We kinda need a little bit more info 'bout the job, milord."
"Tavern_049_02_Carran_NPC","Well, I suppose it's better if you know what you're doing. "
"Tavern_049_03_Carran_NPC","What do you want to know?"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_WRITTEN","About the Legacy Council."
"Tavern_049_04_Principality_WRITTEN","About the Principality."
"Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_WRITTEN","Are you our employer?"
"Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_WRITTEN","We're good, thank you."
"Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_Audio","We should be going, don't you think?"
"Tavern_049_04_Principality_Choice","What can you tell us about this place, the Principality?"
"Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran01","We don't exactly have the time…"
"Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran02","…anyway. The Principality of Masgarth is ruled by Princess Ceiwad Silverflower."
"Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran03","We are a wealthy state, with fertile lands, and the easiest access to the Badlands…"
"Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran04","…through a pass called the Copperhead Road."
"Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran05","We're in the capital, Caer Cyflen, which was once part of the ancient Manacalon Empire of the high elves."
"Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran06","Hence the magnificent elvish buildings up there in the high town."
"Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran07","While we don't have a state religion, all of the major faiths on Solasta are represented here…"
"Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran08","…though we tend to favor Einar, the god of valor and fidelity."
"Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Choice","Are we going to work for you?"
"Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran01","Not exactly, no. I'll be your contact with the Legacy Council, which you will serve as deputies."
"Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran02","That's why we need to go there and get you sworn in."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_Choice","We hear this is a mission for the Council, but what is it, exactly?"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01","Dear Maraike! You don't know?"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02","I'll try to make it simple, but you know - politics…"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03","The Council includes representatives of the most powerful and influential organizations in the Eastern Kingdoms."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04","It was created to lead a joint effort to explore the Badlands."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_WRITTEN","What are the Badlands?"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Choice","What are the Badlands, really?"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran01","Simply put, they are a monster-ridden, chaotic wasteland that used to be the elven empire called Manacalon."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran02","It was destroyed about a thousand years ago by the great Cataclysm."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran03","Now, only ruins remain, full of forgotten knowledge, riches, and dangers."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_WRITTEN","What are the Eastern Kingdoms?"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Choice","Which countries make up these Eastern Kingdoms?"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran01","Simple. The Principality of Masgarth, here, is in the center."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran02","The Snow Alliance lies to the north."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran03","The Kingdom of Gallivan, to the east."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran04","And the New Empire, to the south."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran05","All friendly, more or less, but the peace is fragile."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_WRITTEN","What organizations are there?"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Choice","What are the organizations you mentioned?"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran01","The Council is… how to put it? A non-governmental organization."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran02","Meaning that state governments are not represented, to avoid partisanship."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran03","Instead, there are delegates from the Guild of Antiquarians, the Tower of Knowledge, the Arcaneum, and the Circle of Danantar."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran04","And the Church of Einar guarantees fairness, led by Marshal Beric Sunblaze and Oathkeeper Leira Kean."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_WRITTEN","We know enough."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_Choice","I think we know enough now. Thank you!"
"Tavern_049_Additional_Carran_NPC","Very well."
"Tavern_049_Carran_NPC","Come! Gather your things. You're late for your swearing in."
"Tavern_0410_Stealth_Lawful","Whose fault is that? "
"Tavern_0411_Stealth_Cynical","Hurry up and wait. The story of my life."
"Tavern_0412_Stealth_Academic","I, for one, am very curious to see the inside of that Council room."
"Introduction_Stealth_FindTools","Liam… always thoughtful."
"Introduction_Stealth_Liam_01","There you are, you filthy crook!"
"Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark","You? What…? You're drunk! Get out of here before I kill you!"
"Introduction_Stealth_Liam_02","Think you scare me? Not anymore!"
"Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark2","A grave mistake."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Normal","Ow! I must have fallen on my wrong side… "
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Formal","Ow! That's going to leave a mark."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Slang","Damn! That hurt like hell."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_nosy","Orcs, here? Strange. I wonder what this totem means."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_lukewarm","Just my luck, falling right into an orc hideout!"
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_wisecracker","Orcs? Of course, that explains the smell… "
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_highclass","My word, this is an orc hideout! The malodor is unmistakable."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_preachy","Orcs? Clearly I'm being punished for leaving the road. Now to seek redemption."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_judgmental","Orcs, here? I must report this… which means, I must get out of here alive."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_mean","Damn me, like I needed to fall into an orc shithole!"
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_logical","An orc hideout right in the middle of the Principality… how surprising. Let's hope they've eaten recently."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_normal","What the… ? Whatever this is, it's not good."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_formal","What a peculiar style of art… clearly the work of some savage hand."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_slang","Charming, that. Just as long as my head doesn't end up on the top."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs","There they are… "
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_normal","…if they see me, I'm dead."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_formal","…discretion is clearly the better part of valor in this instance."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_slang","…head down, or I'm next on the menu."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_normal","What's worse, it looks like this is the only way out."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_formal","No other means of egress is apparent."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_slang","They're camped right by the only exit? It just keeps getting better!"
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_normal","I just need to be patient. They can't stay there forever."
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_formal","Fine, then, I shall wait until they go. These creatures do hunt, right?"
"Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_slang","Guess I'm waiting them out. At least these rocks are… damned uncomfortable."
"Council_00_1_Wow_Default","Look at this size of this Council hall!"
"Council_00_2_Wow_Default","A very impressive edifice indeed."
"Council_00_3_joker_Default","So this is what they spend our taxes on."
"Council_00_4_Any_Default","Look! Is that… "
"Council_00_5_Any_Default","The Princess!"
"Council_00_6_Any_Default","Wait… is she leaving?"
"Council_00_7_joker_Default","Apparently so… "
"Council_00_8_Any_Default","Then who will administer the oath?"
"Council_00_9_joker_Default_WRITTEN","The maid who empties her chamber pot?"
"Council_00_9_mean_Default_WRITTEN","We're too low for her."
"Council_00_9_anyother_Default_WRITTEN","It's not her role."
"Council_00_9_joker_Default","The maid who empties her chamber pot? No, we're not as important as that. Perhaps her stable boy."
"Council_00_9_joker_Slang","A lady like her wants nothing to do with drudges like us."
"Council_00_9_anyother_Default_Choice","There's an Oathkeeper for that, I think."
"Council_00_10_Carran_NPC","You thought it would be the Princess? "
"Council_00_11_Any_Default_WRITTEN","She doesn't rule the Council?"
"Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_WRITTEN","If not her, then who?"
"Council_00_11_Any_Default","Doesn't she lead the Council?"
"Council_00_12_Carran_NPC","No, in this chamber, she's just another delegate."
"Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_Choice","If she rules the whole Principality, who's more important?"
"Council_00_12_Carran_NPC_02","Lady Kean, the Council's Oathkeeper, is trusted by all."
"Council_00_15_Chamberlain_NPC","Lord Carran!"
"Council_00_16_Carran_NPC","Yes, m'lady!"
"Council_00_17_Chamberlain_NPC","Are these your new deputies?"
"Council_00_18_Carran_NPC","They are, m'lady."
"Council_00_19_Serious_Default","Very well. Pay attention. All of you."
"Council_00_20_Serious_Slang","Pipe down. "
"Council_00_20_Serious_Normal","Shhh, quiet everyone!"
"Council_00_21_Chamberlain_NPC","My name is Leira Kean, Oathkeeper of the Council."
"Council_00_22_Chamberlain_NPC","And I will be administering your vows."
"Council_00_23_Chamberlain_NPC","Once sworn in, you will carry the authority of the Council wherever you go."
"Council_00_24_Chamberlain_NPC","Your every action will reflect upon the Council's reputation. Remember that. Always."
"Council_00_25_Chamberlain_NPC","Now, please, raise your right hands."
"Council_00_26_Chamberlain_NPC","Do you, each and all, solemnly swear your lives and allegiance to this Council and promise… "
"Council_00_27_Chamberlain_NPC","…to carry out our mission to protect our alliance from those who would threaten the common good?"
"Council_00_28_All_Default_WRITTEN","I swear."
"Council_00_28_All_Default","I swear."
"Council_00_29_Chamberlain_NPC","Excellent. Lord Carran will enter your name into Council's register. Thank you for your service."
"Council_00_30_Carran_NPC","Congratulations, deputies."
"Council_00_31_Any_Default","Wait, that's it?"
"Council_00_32_Joke_WRITTEN","You were expecting a parade?"
"Council_00_32_Longenough_WRITTEN","That was long enough."
"Council_00_32_Exitline_WRITTEN","Let's focus on the mission."
"Council_00_32_joker_Default","What were you expecting? A parade? "
"Council_00_32_joker_Slang","Were you hoping for a kiss from the Princess?"
"Council_00_33_Any_Default","I suppose you imagined something more pompous."
"Council_00_34_Any_Default","No. I don't know. It just feels a bit… anticlimactic."
"Council_00_35_Carran_NPC","Sorry to disappoint. "
"Council_00_32_Longenough_Choice","Frankly, the speech was long enough for my taste."
"Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran01","The formality reflects the solemnity of your oath."
"Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran02","But more would probably be… immodest."
"Council_00_32_Exitline_Choice","Stop wasting time! What's the mission?"
"Council_00_32_Exitline_Carran","Well! A motivated deputy."
"Council_00_42_Carran_NPC","So - the mission:"
"Council_00_44_Carran_NPC","As I'm sure you know, the Council maintains a number of outposts… "
"Council_00_45_Carran_NPC","…to secure the border between the Principality and the Marches."
"Council_00_46_Carran_NPC","One of them is the former Imperial Fortress, Caer Lem."
"Council_00_47_Carran_NPC","It is held by some fifty troops under the command of Captain Henrik."
"Council_00_48_Carran_NPC","He sends us weekly status reports - or rather, he used to."
"Council_00_49_Carran_NPC","We haven't heard a word from him in three weeks."
"Council_00_50_Carran_NPC","Leave immediately for Caer Lem and find out if anyone there is still alive."
"Council_00_51_Carran_NPC","If Captain Henrik or anyone else is still breathing, bring them back."
"Council_00_52_Carran_NPC","The Council wants a first-hand report."
"Council_00_53_Dangerous_WRITTEN","Sounds dangerous."
"Council_00_54_Marches_WRITTEN","Wait - you spoke of the Marches?"
"Council_00_55_Henrik_WRITTEN","Tell us about Captain Henrik."
"Council_00_56_ExitLine_WRITTEN","We're good to go."
"Council_00_57_Dangerous_Choice","A whole garrison, gone? There are only four of us."
"Council_00_58_Dangerous_Carran01","Just find out what happened. Run back if you get scared."
"Council_00_42_Joker_Normal","Got it. Though we were hoping for a first mission with more riches than risk, if you catch my drift."
"Council_00_42_Joker_Slang","We hear ya. Just so you know, we'd like to start slow. Meaning more treasure. Less danger."
"Council_00_59_Carran_NPC","You don't get to choose your mission, I'm afraid."
"Council_00_53_Carran_NPC","So gather what you need and go. Time is of the essence."
"Council_00_60_Marches_Choice","Wait! These Marches - they're not in the Badlands, are they?"
"Council_00_61_Marches_Carran01","The Marches are a no-man's-land, between the civilized world and the Badlands."
"Council_00_62_Marches_Carran02","It's outside the chain of mountains that really define the Badlands."
"Council_00_63_Marches_Carran03","We wouldn't send you in there… yet."
"Council_00_64_Henrik_Choice","What can you tell us about this Captain Henrik?"
"Council_00_65_Henrik_Carran01","A fine officer. More than fifteen years in the Principality's army."
"Council_00_66_Henrik_Carran02","He inspires trust, loyalty, and courage - hence the decision to post him there, facing danger."
"Council_00_54_Any_Default","Right, I guess that's that. It's on to Caer Lem."
"PotionsShop_Dialog_01_1_PotionShopOwner_NPC","Hello! How may I help you?"
"PotionsShop_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN","What do you sell?"
"PotionsShop_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN","Can we see your wares?"
"PotionsShop_Dialog_01_4_Any_Default","What do you sell here?"
"PotionsShop_Dialog_01_5_PotionShopOwner_NPC","Mostly potions, for heroic adventurers like yourselves."
"PotionsShop_Dialog_01_6_PotionShopOwner_NPC","I also have recipes for customers who like to craft their own."
"PotionsShop_Dialog_01_7_PotionShopOwner_NPC","And ingredients too - even rare flowers from the Badlands."
"PotionsShop_Dialog_01_8_PotionShopOwner_NPC","Come back any time - I'm almost always open!"
"GeneralStore_Dialog_01_1_StoreOwner_NPC","Welcome to Gorim's Emporium!"
"GeneralStore_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN","Are you Gorim?"
"GeneralStore_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN","What do you sell?"
"GeneralStore_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN","Can we see your wares?"
"GeneralStore_Dialog_01_5_Any_Default","Are you Gorim?"
"GeneralStore_Dialog_01_6_StoreOwner_NPC","That's me! The one and only."
"GeneralStore_Dialog_01_7_Any_Default","What do you have to sell?"
"GeneralStore_Dialog_01_8_StoreOwner_NPC","Everything you'll need for going out there into the Badlands…"
"GeneralStore_Dialog_01_9_StoreOwner_NPC","…food, ropes, torches - and of course, armor and weapons."
"GeneralStore_Dialog_01_10_StoreOwner_NPC","I also have some other stock, like remedies and antitoxins. "
"GeneralStore_Dialog_01_11_StoreOwner_NPC","They might come in handy. Ever heard of deep spiders?"
"Bartender_Dialog_01_1_Bartender_NPC","Hello, adventurers!"
"Bartender_Dialog_01_2_Bartender_NPC","What can I offer you?"
"Bartender_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN","Tell us about this place."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN","Your beer tastes bad."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_5_Any_WRITTEN","We need a room."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any_WRITTEN","Goodbye."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any","We should go."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_6_Any_Default","Tell us about your tavern."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_7_Bartender_NPC","The inn? Well, it's not that old, but somehow it feels like it's been here forever."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_8_Bartender_NPC","You can meet all kinds of people here, that's the good thing."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_9_Bartender_NPC","An old Scavenger, a diplomat from the Council, a knight, a lord, a beggar…"
"Bartender_Dialog_01_10_Bartender_NPC","We also have rooms to rent by the night."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_10_1_Any_Default","Why the name - Gravekeep's Cask?"
"Bartender_Dialog_01_10_2_Bartender_NPC","It's very old, from Imperial times. Perhaps a historian would know, but I don't."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_11_Any_Default","Your beer is terrible, and that's being polite about it."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_12_Bartender_NPC","What? I've never had any complaints about the beer before!"
"Bartender_Dialog_01_13_Bartender_NPC","Maybe your palate is not refined enough."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default","We'd like to stay for the night."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_15_Bartender_NPC","Sure! Just walk up to the suite and settle in."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_16_Any_Default","A suite? "
"Bartender_Dialog_01_17_Bartender_NPC","It's more like a large bedroom, really - but you know, this is the capital city."
"Bartender_Dialog_01_NoMoneyToPay","No money, eh. No room, then. "
"Scavengers_Generic_Hello","Clear skies, my friends."
"Scavengers_Generic_Goodbye","Stay in the light, my friends."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_1_Quartermaster_NPC","Deputies? A word, if you please."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_2_Joker_Default","So famous already? I love it!"
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_3_Any_Default","You were in there, too. Are you a member of the Council?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_4_Quartermaster_NPC","I'm Annie Bagmordah, Quartermaster of the Scavenger's guild."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_5_Quartermaster_NPC","We don't have a seat in there, but…"
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_6_Quartermaster_NPC","…they all know exploring the Badlands without us would be a bad idea."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_7_Quartermaster_NPC","That's why you should stop by our headquarters downtown."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_8_Quartermaster_NPC","You'll need our services, I'm sure."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_9_Any_Default","Is that… compulsory?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_10_Quartermaster_NPC","No, but you'll find our services useful. Everyone does."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_11_Quartermaster_NPC","Did lord Carran not tell you?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_12_Any_Default","No - he pretty much stuck to giving orders."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_13_Quartermaster_NPC","Ah, right. Anyway, we offer plenty of help and advice to beginners like you."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_14_Joker_Default","We are grown-ups, you know. At least, most of us are."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_15_Quartermaster_NPC","Of course you are. Well, good luck!"
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_16_Lowlife_Default","At least she's not another lady or something."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_17_Lawkeeper_Default","Scavengers, eh? I never knew if they were legit or not."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_18_Sellsword_Default","They're tough, these Scavengers. Fearless."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_19_Highclass_Default","Inviting beggars to the Council? How peculiar."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_20_Acolyte_Default","I'd rather visit the temple, honestly."
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_21_Nosy_Default","The Scavengers! They've seen so much already - the first explorers of the ancient empire!"
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_22_Authority_Default","So what do you think? Should we check out their headquarters? "
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_23_Pragmatism_Default","It's not far, but…"
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_24_Violence_Default","I've had enough talking - let's go kill some monsters!"
"Scavengers_Dialog_01_25_Greed_Default","If there's business to be done, we can't afford not to!"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Quartermaster_NPC","Ah - you came!"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Any_Default","You piqued our curiosity. So - what exactly do you have to offer?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Quartermaster_NPC","You don't know? Tsk."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","What help do you offer?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_NosyAuthority_WRITTEN","Do you know Arwin Merton?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Selfpres_WRITTEN","Do you sell healing potions?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Default_WRITTEN","See you later."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Pragmatic_Default","What kind of help do you offer to people like us?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Quartermaster_NPC","Simple. Now, people like you typically carry out missions for the Council…"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_9_Quartermaster_NPC","…in the Marches, even the Badlands. Sometimes far away, like Captain Merran."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_10_NosyAuthority_Default","Who's Captain Merran?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_11_Quartermaster_NPC","You really must be new. She's one of yours: Senior Deputy of the Council."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_12_Quartermaster_NPC","Anyway - you trek out to some old ruin in the Badlands, kill a bunch of orcs…"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_13_Quartermaster_NPC","…well, you're still a bit green, so let's say goblins."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_14_Joker_Default","Ouch! You're hurting our feelings!"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_15_Quartermaster_NPC","Orcs will hurt more than your feelings, believe me."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_16_Quartermaster_NPC","And stop interrupting! It's rude."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_17_Quartermaster_NPC","So let's say you find yourself with a whole load of rusty swords, leather armor, shields…"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_18_Quartermaster_NPC","…too much for you to lug back here."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_19_Joker_Default","Oh - so we're puny as well as green? Thanks so much!"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_20_Quartermaster_NPC","So instead, you brave heroes just clear the place of monsters and draw us a nice, clean map."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_21_Quartermaster_NPC","Then we take our carts and pick up every piece of junk…"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_22_Quartermaster_NPC","…we bring it back, we sell it, and we split the profits with you."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_23_Quartermaster_NPC","We move the stuff, you go off to kill more bad things, everybody wins."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_24_Joker_Default","For a percentage, of course."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_25_Quartermaster_NPC","What? You could never carry it all, anyway."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_26_Quartermaster_NPC","Not in your little backpacks."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_27_NosyAuthority_Default","Do you know Arwin Merton, the so-called First Scavenger?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_28_Quartermaster_NPC","Of course."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_29_NosyAuthority_Default","That's it?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_30_Quartermaster_NPC","Merton… it's a painful topic for me. "
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_31_Quartermaster_NPC","I'd rather not talk about him."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_32_Friendly_Default","Fair enough."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_33_Selfpres_Default","Do you sell healing potions?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_34_Quartermaster_NPC","No, we don't. There's a shop for that."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_35_Quartermaster_NPC","However…"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_36_Quartermaster_NPC","We've got something even better."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_37_Quartermaster_NPC","Say one of you gets killed out there in the Badlands."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_38_Joker_Default","Here we go again…"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_39_Quartermaster_NPC","Normally, you'd have to come back in a hurry to get them raised."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_40_Quartermaster_NPC","Instead, you tell us about your misfortune, and we'll go get your friend's body."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_41_Quartermaster_NPC","We take it to a cleric we know, and praise be! He raises your friend from the dead."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_42_Quartermaster_NPC","It's a flat fee, and very reasonably priced."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_43_Quartermaster_NPC","Not a comfortable subject, I know. Perish the thought and so on - but it happens."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_44_Greed_Default","That's not cheap, I'm sure."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_45_Quartermaster_NPC","Well… it's risky, and clerics need pretty gemstones for these spells… but can you really put a price on peace of mind?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_46_Authority_Default","Well, thank you. I guess that's it for us."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_47_Quartermaster_NPC","Fine. Feel free to visit us anytime. Or drop into any Scavenger camp."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_48_Nosy_Authority_Default","Are there others?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_49_Quartermaster_NPC","Anywhere we can settle. "
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_50_Quartermaster_NPC","By the way, if you find Captain Henrik, tell him we're still interested."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_51_Authority_Default","In what?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_52_Quartermaster_NPC","In getting our people to Caer Lem."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_53_Quartermaster_NPC","The outpost is perfect for us. Close to the Badlands, with plenty of space for our camp."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_54_Authority_Default","Right, we'll tell him if we find him."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_55_Quartermaster_NPC","That would be appreciated. "
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_56_Quartermaster_NPC","The more you do for us, the more we do for you."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_57_Greed_Default","Oh? So this… business relationship can get better?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_58_Quartermaster_NPC","And I hope it will, friend."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_59_Any_Default","I guess we'll see you around, then."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_60_Quartermaster_NPC","Sure. Good luck out there, and don't forget - in the Badlands, always keep your eyes open."
"CaerLem_Arrival1_Starter_Noflag","So that's Caer Lem?"
"CaerLem_Arrival2_Partner_Noflag","We're almost there… it's just up the hill."
"CaerLem_Arrival3_SelfPres_Noflag","It's a little too quiet, don't you think?"
"CaerLem_Arrival4_Pragmatism_Slang","We're in the Marches, so quiet can't be trusted."
"CaerLem_Arrival5_SelfPres_Normal","True. Let's keep our eyes open."
"CaerLem_Arrival6_SelfPres_Formal","Quite so. We must be on our guard."
"CaerLem_Arrival7_Authority_Normal","Eyes up and hands on hilts, people. These are the Marches."
"CaerLem_Arrival8_Authority_Formal","Hold formation, all! The Marches are full of perils."
"CaerLem_Arrival9_Selfish_Cynical_Normal","Who put you in charge?"
"CaerLem_Arrival10_Selfish_Cynical_Slang","Don't play the captain with me."
"CaerLem_Arrival11_Authority_Normal","I'm just saying, be ready for anything."
"CaerLem_Arrival12_Authority_Formal","Simply a suggestion. I meant no offense."
"CaerLem_Arrival13_Default_Slang","Damn right. Let's get on with it."
"CaerLem_Arrival14_Default_Normal","All right. Let's just keep going."
"CaerLem_Arrival15_Default_Formal","Agreed. We should press on."
"CaerLem_Entrance16_Default_Noflag","I have a bad feeling about this."
"CaerLem_Entrance17_Partner_Slang","Where's the garrison? Dead or run away?"
"CaerLem_Entrance18_Partner_Normal","There's no one here. Not even corpses."
"CaerLem_Entrance19_Default_Noflag","Look! That tower… that's insane!"
"CaerLem_Entrance20_NOSY_Noflag","Amazing! Classic Tirmarian architecture… I read about that, you know."
"CaerLem_Entrance21_NOSY_Noflag","It just ended up here after the Cataclysm… incredible!"
"CaerLem_Entrance22_LUKEWARM_Slang","Courtesy of the Cataclysm."
"CaerLem_Entrance23_LUKEWARM_Slang","The Marches are full of stuff like this. The Badlands are worse."
"CaerLem_Entrance24_Cynic_Normal","I never saw a tower just stuck in a mountain like that."
"CaerLem_Entrance25_Default_Normal","We're not in the Badlands yet, but that's a good introduction."
"CaerLem_Entrance26_Authority_law_Noflag","Anyway, we have a mission. Let's check the fortifications."
"CaerLem_InspectBattlefield1_Cynical_Formal","Well, that's not a good sign."
"CaerLem_InspectBattlefield2_Cynical_Normal","Does this tell us anything we don't already know?"
"CaerLem_InspectBattlefield3_Pragmatic_Normal","The blood isn't that fresh, but even vultures would have left some bones behind."
"CaerLem_InspectBattlefield4_Pragmatic_Formal","There's enough blood here to suggest that the whole garrison was massacred."
"CaerLem_InspectBattlefield5_Any_Normal","Maybe it was the goblins… they took the soldiers and… ate them?"
"CaerLem_InspectBattlefield6_Pragmatic_Normal","Those goblins were only a handful… A fifty-strong garrison would have made mincemeat of them."
"CaerLem_InspectBattlefield7_Any_Normal","Well then, I'm out of ideas. Let's keep looking around."
"CaerLem_Inside27_Pragmatism_Noflag","There's definitely been fighting here."
"CaerLem_Inside28_cynicWISECRACKER_Noflag","Why did we take this job again? Oh, yeah… these lovely Council badges."
"CaerLem_Inside29_cynicWISECRACKER_Formal","No one here to greet us? How rude! I was hoping for drinks, at least."
"CaerLem_Inside30_Authority_React","This is no time for jokes."
"CaerLem_Inside31_Selfpres_Noflag","Right. Whoever did this could still be around, and we don't want them hearing us."
"CaerLem_Inside32_Helpful_Noflag","We should look for survivors. Fifty people can't just vanish."
"CaerLem_Seenthem33_Starter_Normal","Did you see that?"
"CaerLem_Seenthem34_Starter_Slang","What the heck was that?"
"CaerLem_Seenthem35_Partner_Default","Someone's hiding inside the tower."
"CaerLem_Seenthem36_Self_Pres_Default","It's a trap! The goblins killed everyone, and now it's our turn!"
"CaerLem_Seenthem37_Helpful_Default","Or they're the survivors, and they're being cautious."
"CaerLem_Seenthem38_Pragmatism_Default","We need to get up to that door."
"CaerLem_Seenthem39_Selfpres_Default","That won't be easy. These walls are falling apart."
"CaerLem_Seenthem40_Violence_Default","If they slaughtered the garrison, they'll pay!"
"CaerLem_Seenthem41_Beryl_NPC","Back off! No closer!"
"CaerLem_Seenthem42_Starter_Default","Who's there?"
"CaerLem_Seenthem43_Robar_NPC","We're not letting you in!"
"CaerLem_Seenthem44_Beryl_NPC","And we're not coming out!"
"CaerLem_Seenthem47_Starter_Default","Is Captain Henrik there? We need to talk to him!"
"CaerLem_Seenthem48_Beryl_NPC","Don't you dare speak his name, you filthy bastard!"
"CaerLem_Seenthem49_Robar_NPC","Don't talk to them!"
"CaerLem_Seenthem50_Lisbath_NPC","They'll cast a spell on you!"
"CaerLem_Seenthem51_Beryl_NPC","Don't touch me!"
"CaerLem_Seenthem52_Pragmatism_Normal","Is something not right in there, or is it just me?"
"CaerLem_Seenthem53_Pragmatism_Slang","Lost their minds, the lot of 'em."
"CaerLem_Seenthem54_Pragmatism_Formal","Clearly their distressing experience has affected their reason."
"CaerLem_Seenthem55_Joker_Normal","Filthy bastard'. Should we write that down in our report?"
"CaerLem_Seenthem56_Joker_Slang","That's our report, then: they've all gone crazy. Mystery solved."
"CaerLem_Nego78_Practical_Default","Let's get to the door. Maybe if they can see us up close… "
"CaerLem_Nego79_Practical_Default","…we can show them our Council badges."
"CaerLem_Nego1_Robar_NPC","They're here!"
"CaerLem_Nego2_Beryl_NPC","You damn Soraks!"
"CaerLem_Nego3_Starter_Default","Soraks?"
"CaerLem_Nego4_Partner_Default","Did they say Soraks?"
"CaerLem_Nego5_Starter_Slang","Ooh, they spotted it… we're shapeshifters from another world! Guess we'll have to go home now."
"CaerLem_Nego6_Starter_Normal","You can't be serious! Soraks are a legend for scaring children. "
"CaerLem_Nego7_Beryl_NPC","You bastards took the Captain, but you won't take us!"
"CaerLem_Nego8_Robar_NPC","Don't talk to them!"
"CaerLem_Nego9_Choice_1_WRITTEN","We're Council deputies!"
"CaerLem_Nego10_Choice_2_WRITTEN","Use spy call phrase"
"CaerLem_Nego11_Choice_3_WRITTEN","Use sellsword experience"
"CaerLem_Nego12_Choice_4_WRITTEN","Be reasonable!"
"CaerLem_Nego13_Authority_Normal","We're deputies of the Council, sent by Protector Leira Kean!"
"CaerLem_Nego14_Beryl_FailedCheck","Nice to meet you… I'm Princess Ceiwad. Get lost!"
"CaerLem_Nego15_Lisbath_FailedCheck","Open the damn door, there are only four of them."
"CaerLem_Nego16_Robar_SuccessCheck","They have Council badges."
"CaerLem_Nego17_Beryl_SuccessCheck","Sure. Of course they do! Looted from whose corpses?"
"CaerLem_Nego18_Spy_Default","So, sleeping in the beds of the Manacalon, are you?"
"CaerLem_Nego19_Beryl_NPC","What?"
"CaerLem_Nego20_Defaulter_Default","What was that?"
"CaerLem_Nego21_Spy_Default","Just fishing. Give it a moment."
"CaerLem_Nego22_Darik_NPC","Magic pillows give us sweet dreams."
"CaerLem_Nego24_Sellsword_Default","I know how you feel… I fought at Sandreed. Lost a lot of good friends there."
"CaerLem_Nego25_Robar_NPC","Sandreed, eh? Which unit?"
"CaerLem_Nego26_Beryl_NPC","What happened to ""don't talk to them""?"
"CaerLem_Nego27_Sellsword_Default","The Longswords, under Lord Dalmore."
"CaerLem_Nego28_Sellsword_Default","He died on the third day… arrow in the eye. "
"CaerLem_Nego29_Sellsword_Default","Jonas Mills was the real leader… fought to the bitter end."
"CaerLem_Nego30_Robar_NPC","Open up… they're not Soraks."
"CaerLem_Nego31_Defaulter_Default","Be reasonable and open the door. We're friendlies!"
"CaerLem_Nego32_Beryl_NPC","Exactly what a Sorak would say."
"CaerLem_Nego33_Defaulter_Default","Come on! There are just four of us… Point crossbows at us if you like."
"CaerLem_Nego34_Lisbath_NPC","Let's do that! People… crossbows at the ready."
"CaerLem_Nego35_Robar_NPC","Fine with me. Daliat, open the door."
"CaerLem_Nego36_Beryl_NPC","No! I said no!"
"CaerLem_Nego37_Robar_NPC","Close the door."
"CaerLem_Nego38_Starter_Default","Thank you for letting us in."
"CaerLem_Nego39_Beryl_NPC","Don't thank me."
"CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_WRITTEN","Are you the officer?"
"CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_WRITTEN","You thought we were Soraks?"
"CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_WRITTEN","Can we talk to the others?"
"CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_Default","Are you in charge here?"
"CaerLem_Nego41_Beryl_NPC","Lieutenant Beryl Stonebeard."
"CaerLem_Nego42_Beryl_NPC","Second in command… After Captain Henrik."
"CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_Default","So, you really believe you were attacked by Soraks?"
"CaerLem_Nego44_Beryl_NPC","Man-sized lizards that can speak? "
"CaerLem_Nego45_Beryl_NPC","Oh, yeah… they're real."
"CaerLem_Nego46_Starter_NPC","But we found no corpses… nothing."
"CaerLem_Nego47_Beryl_NPC","We know. They took all the bodies, ours and theirs."
"CaerLem_Nego48_Beryl_NPC","So no one can prove they exist."
"CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","That's awkward."
"CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","That's hard to believe."
"CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","That's garbage."
"CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_Normal","No proof… that's kind of awkward."
"CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_Formal","You realize, of course, how improbable that sounds?"
"CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_Slang","Course they did… just to make you look crazy."
"CaerLem_Nego52_Beryl_NPC","You won't laugh when they come back."
"CaerLem_Nego53_Default_Default","We got here without trouble."
"CaerLem_Nego54_Beryl_NPC","Then they let you in… and now you're trapped with us."
"CaerLem_Nego55_Starter_Default","Why would they do that?"
"CaerLem_Nego56_Beryl_NPC","How should I know? They're Soraks!"
"CaerLem_Nego57_Starter_Slang","Mind if we talk to your buddies?"
"CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_Formal","Might we have a little chat with your comrades in arms?"
"CaerLem_Nego59_Starter_Normal","We'd like to talk to everyone here, if that's all right?"
"CaerLem_Nego60_Beryl_NPC","As long as you don't try anything clever, we're good."
"CaerLem_Darik1_Spy_Default","I might have a better chance with this guy… alone."
"CaerLem_Darik2_SelfpresLawful_Default","I don't like being kept in the dark."
"CaerLem_Darik3_Spy_Default","I used to work in an embassy. Learned a few tricks."
"CaerLem_Darik4_Starter_Default","He doesn't strike me as the diplomatic type."
"CaerLem_Darik5_Mean_Default","He looks like any other beggar."
"CaerLem_Darik6_Spy_Default","Come on, trust me."
"CaerLem_Darik7_Nosy_Default","What exactly is it between you and him?"
"CaerLem_Darik8_Einar_Default","We trust you to do what's best for us all."
"CaerLem_Darik9_Pakri_Default","Pakri watches. Don't betray her trust."
"CaerLem_Darik10_Spy_Default","Leave the goddess out of this, will you?"
"CaerLem_Darik11_Defaulter_Default","If you do then, please, be our guest."
"CaerLem_Darik12_Spy_NPC","I saw a Whisperer's code carved in the door."
"CaerLem_Darik13_Darik_NPC","How do you know the code?"
"CaerLem_Darik14_Spy_Default","I used to work for Delanim, at the embassy near the New Empire border."
"CaerLem_Darik15_Darik_NPC","I see. I'm supposed to kill anyone who knows those words and isn't a Whisperer."
"CaerLem_Darik16_Spy_Default","I'd appreciate if you didn't kill me, though."
"CaerLem_Darik17_Darik_NPC","We'll see."
"CaerLem_Darik18_Spy_Default","So, just to be sure, is any of this part of your business, or… "
"CaerLem_Darik19_Darik_NPC","Wiping out a whole garrison just to get myself trapped with this bunch? No, that wasn't my plan."
"CaerLem_Darik20_Spy_Default","So… Soraks? Really?"
"CaerLem_Darik21_Darik_NPC","What can I tell you? They looked just like the stories say."
"CaerLem_Darik22_Darik_NPC","The Captain betrayed us… they knew everything about our security."
"CaerLem_Darik23_Darik_NPC","Even hiding their bodies is in the stories."
"CaerLem_Darik24_Starter_Default","Think they're still around?"
"CaerLem_Darik25_Darik_NPC","Possibly."
"CaerLem_Darik26_Spy_Default","Any idea what they're after?"
"CaerLem_Darik27_Darik_NPC","No."
"CaerLem_Darik28_Spy_Default","Right. "
"CaerLem_Darik29_Spy_Default","They'll want to talk to you."
"CaerLem_Darik30_Darik_NPC","Fine."
"CaerLem_Darik31_Spy_Default","He's all yours."
"CaerLem_Darik32_Starter_Default","So who are you, friend?"
"CaerLem_Darik33_Darik_NPC","Daliat Sunbird, scout."
"CaerLem_Darik34_Starter_Default","Do you believe they were Soraks?"
"CaerLem_Darik35_Darik_NPC","Dunno. Seemed real, though."
"CaerLem_Darik36_Starter_Default","What do you think they wanted? "
"CaerLem_Darik37_Darik_NPC","To kill us all."
"CaerLem_Darik38_Any_Normal","Not big on talk, eh?"
"CaerLem_Darik39_Any_Formal","You seem a very reluctant conversationalist."
"CaerLem_Darik40_Darik_NPC","I'm gonna rest now."
"CaerLem_Darik40_Alternate_Darik_NPC","I'm having a pretty bad day, so if you'll excuse me…"
"CaerLem_Darik41_AnySelfpres_NPC","Is it me, or didn't he like that last question?"
"CaerLem_Darik42_Cynical_NPC","Nice man."
"CaerLem_Darik43_Starter_Default","How about you? Did you learn anything?"
"CaerLem_Darik44_Spy_Default","Not much. He thinks the Soraks are real, too."
"CaerLem_Darik45_Partner_Default","So much for your secret code."
"CaerLem_Darik46_Spy_Default","Sorry to disappoint."
"CaerLem_Lisbath1_Lisbath_NPC","Now it's my turn, right?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath2_Starter_Default","What do you mean?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath3_Lisbath_NPC","What is this? A murder investigation?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath4_Cynical_WRITTEN","Should it be?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath5_Defaulter_WRITTEN","Just trying to help."
"CaerLem_Lisbath6_Authority_WRITTEN","Anything we should know?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath7_Cynical_Default","Should we be investigating?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath7_Lisbath_NPC","Maybe. "
"CaerLem_Lisbath8_Authority_Formal","You've said too much to stop now. "
"CaerLem_Lisbath9_Authority_Normal","Speak up, then. "
"CaerLem_Lisbath10_Lisbath_NPC","Well, let's say this all happened after a certain expedition. "
"CaerLem_Lisbath11_Any_Normal","Go on."
"CaerLem_Lisbath12_Any_Slang","Spit it out."
"CaerLem_Lisbath13_Any_Formal","Speak up without fear, friend."
"CaerLem_Lisbath14_Lisbath_NPC","The scouts. They came back from a raid into the Badlands. "
"CaerLem_Lisbath15_Lisbath_NPC","Found a ruin, came back with loot. "
"CaerLem_Lisbath16_Lisbath_NPC","The next day, this happens. "
"CaerLem_Lisbath17_Lisbath_NPC","Coincidence? You tell me. "
"CaerLem_Lisbath18_Any_Default","The scouts, you say?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath19_Lisbath_NPC","Only one of them's still alive."
"CaerLem_Lisbath20_Lisbath_NPC","Daliat."
"CaerLem_Lisbath21_Any_Default","Right."
"CaerLem_Lisbath22_Defaulter_Default","We just want to help."
"CaerLem_Lisbath23_Lisbath_NPC","Good luck with that."
"CaerLem_Lisbath24_Authority_Default","You sound worried. Anything we should know?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath25_Lisbath_NPC","Get lost!"
"CaerLem_Lisbath26_Defaulter_WRITTEN","Sorry."
"CaerLem_Lisbath27_Insight_WRITTEN","You're hiding something."
"CaerLem_Lisbath28_Authority_WRITTEN","I don't like your tone."
"CaerLem_Lisbath29_Mean_WRITTEN","Go to hell."
"CaerLem_Lisbath30_Defaulter_Default","No offense intended."
"CaerLem_Lisbath31_Insight_Default","I'll take that as a yes. "
"CaerLem_Lisbath32_Authority_Default","I don't like to be insulted."
"CaerLem_Lisbath33_Mean_Default","You go to hell, you spineless moron."
"CaerLem_Lisbath34_Lisbath_NPC","You should work on your manners, then. "
"CaerLem_Lisbath35_Lisbath_NPC","And I don't like to be accused of… whatever. "
"CaerLem_Lisbath36_Defaulter_WRITTEN","Never mind."
"CaerLem_Lisbath37_Persuader_WRITTEN","We started on the wrong foot."
"CaerLem_Lisbath38_Intimidator_WRITTEN","Speak up, or else!"
"CaerLem_Lisbath39_Deceiver_WRITTEN","We know there's a traitor."
"CaerLem_Lisbath40_Defaulter_Default","Get lost."
"CaerLem_Lisbath41_Persuader_Default","Can we start this over?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath42_Lisbath_Success","Listen. Something's not right."
"CaerLem_Lisbath43_Lisbath_Failure","I don't think so."
"CaerLem_Lisbath44_Intimidator_Default","You'll tell me sooner or later. Later's more painful."
"CaerLem_Lisbath45_Lisbath_NPC","Friends, right?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath46_Lisbath_NPC","Bring it on."
"CaerLem_Lisbath47_Deceiver_Default","We know there's a traitor among you."
"CaerLem_Lisbath48_Deceiver_Default","Help us, and we'll help you."
"CaerLem_Lisbath49_Lisbath_Success","I… I knew it. It's Daliat, right?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath50_Lisbath_NPC","Shh! He's looking at us!"
"CaerLem_Lisbath51_Lisbath_NPC","I'll tell you what."
"CaerLem_Lisbath52_Lisbath_Failure","You think you can fool me that easily?"
"CaerLem_Lisbath53_Lisbath_NPC","I don't buy it."
"CaerLem_Lisbath55_AsAYes","You must have a hearing problem, then."
"CaerLem_Robar1_Starter_Default","Hey, there."
"CaerLem_Robar2_Starter_Formal","Greetings, soldier."
"CaerLem_Robar3_Robar_NPC","Aye."
"CaerLem_Robar4_Robar_NPC","Name's Robar Sharp."
"CaerLem_Robar5_Starter_Normal","Sounds like you're the most experienced here, Robar."
"CaerLem_Robar6_Starter_Formal","I gather you are a veteran of long standing?"
"CaerLem_Robar7_Starter_Slang","So you're the old sweat of the group, huh?"
"CaerLem_Robar8_Robar_NPC","Yeah. But I'm not in charge, mind you."
"CaerLem_Robar9_Starter_Default","Tell us about Stonebeard."
"CaerLem_Robar10_Partner_Default","Tell us about Daliat."
"CaerLem_Robar11_Commentator_Default","Tell us about Lisbath."
"CaerLem_Robar11_Reactor_Default","What should we do?"
"CaerLem_Robar12_Sellsword_Default","Mercenary small talk"
"CaerLem_Robar13_Partner_Default","This Lieutenant Stonebeard… is she up to the job?"
"CaerLem_Robar14_Robar_NPC","Clearly not. Look around."
"CaerLem_Robar15_Robar_NPC","Losing the captain broke her."
"CaerLem_Robar16_Partner_Default","What do you think of Daliat?"
"CaerLem_Robar17_Robar_NPC","Never liked him. He's hiding something."
"CaerLem_Robar18_Robar_NPC","He's been nervous since we came back from the Badlands."
"CaerLem_Robar19_Robar_NPC","But it'd be no good picking a fight with him now… "
"CaerLem_Robar20_Starter_Formal","Very wise."
"CaerLem_Robar21_Starter_Normal","I understand."
"CaerLem_Robar22_Commentator_Default","How about Lisbath? You're her superior?"
"CaerLem_Robar23_Robar_NPC","Good woman. Strong, brave."
"CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_NPC","You can trust her with a sword… "
"CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_NPC","…that's worth something in my book."
"CaerLem_Robar26_Sellsword_Default","So you fought at Sandreed too?"
"CaerLem_Robar27_Robar_NPC","Oh, yeah. Got the scars from rebel arrows to prove it."
"CaerLem_Robar28_Sellsword_NPC","Oh, those damned skirmishers! They gave me a few holes, too."
"CaerLem_Robar29_Sellsword_Default","Well, if we survived Sandreed, we'll both make it through this."
"CaerLem_Robar30_Robar_NPC","That's the plan."
"CaerLem_Robar31_Starter_Default","So what do you think we should do?"
"CaerLem_Robar31_Robar_NPC","For starters, not wait in here for the Soraks to come back and off us."
"CaerLem_Robar32_Sellsword_Default","But Stonebeard says stay, and she's an officer, so… ?"
"CaerLem_Robar33_Sellsword_Default","Yeah. She's a stubborn one, and mutiny's a bad look on a soldier."
"CaerLem_Robar34_Robar_NPC","You could talk to her, deputy of the Council and all."
"CaerLem_Robar35_Sellsword_Default","So if we find a way, you're with us?"
"CaerLem_Robar36_Starter_Default","I'm with myself. But don't let that stop you."
"CaerLem_Internal1_Authority_Normal","Right… we need to make a decision here."
"CaerLem_Internal2_Authority_Formal","It's clear that something must be done."
"CaerLem_Internal3_Einar_Normal","The Soraks are real? It's a lot to take in."
"CaerLem_Internal4_Einar_Formal","I'm shocked by the thought that Soraks might be real."
"CaerLem_Internal5_Mean_Slang","They're either crazy or stupid… no use to us in either case."
"CaerLem_Internal6_Cynical_Normal","We have enough to make our report to the Council, so let's get going."
"CaerLem_Internal7_Cynical_Formal","They can't help themselves or anyone else. We should return to Caer Cyflen."
"CaerLem_Internal8_Cynical_Slang","Let 'em rot. We're supposed to bring back Henrik, not them. "
"CaerLem_Internal9_Helpful_Normal","If we don't help them, they'll either die or kill each other."
"CaerLem_Internal10_Violent_Normal","Let them. Could be fun to watch."
"CaerLem_Internal11_Selpres_Normal","This place is a death trap, we should get out while we can."
"CaerLem_Internal12_Defaulter_Normal","So everyone has an opinion… but what are we going to do?"
"CaerLem_Internal13_Defaulter_Normal","And what about Daliat? We got some pretty worrying hints about him."
"CaerLem_Internal14_Defaulter_Normal","What if he really is hiding something important?"
"CaerLem_Internal15_Authority_WRITTEN","We confront him."
"CaerLem_Internal16_Violent_WRITTEN","He might be a traitor."
"CaerLem_Internal17_Default_WRITTEN","It's just gossip."
"CaerLem_Internal18_Selfpres_WRITTEN","Let's not risk a fight."
"CaerLem_Internal19_Authority_Normal","We need to talk to him, find out the truth."
"CaerLem_Internal20_Violent_Answer","If he's a traitor, we can't look the other way."
"CaerLem_Internal21_Default_Answer","It's just paranoia, or personal grudges."
"CaerLem_Internal22_Selfpres_Answer","If we accuse him, it might end in blood."
"CaerLem_Internal23_Default_Answer","That leaves us with the others. What's our strategy?"
"CaerLem_Internal24_Autority_WRITTEN","We take the lead."
"CaerLem_Internal25_Selpres_WRITTEN","We get out of here."
"CaerLem_Internal26_Default_WRITTEN","Let's talk to them all together."
"CaerLem_Internal27_Cynicsm_WRITTEN","We push Sharp to mutiny."
"CaerLem_Internal28_Authority_Answer","We tell Stonebeard we're in charge, and take them home."
"CaerLem_Internal29_Selpres_Answer","We get the hell out of here. They can either follow or stay here to die."
"CaerLem_Internal30_Default_Answer","Let's just get them together and discuss this."
"CaerLem_Internal31_Cynicsm_Answer","We tell Sharp to challenge Stonebeard, with our support."
"CaerLem_Internal32_Any_Reaction","All right."
"CaerLem_Internal33_Any_Reaction","I'm not sure, but… fine."
"CaerLem_Internal34_Any_Reaction","Agreed."
"CaerLem_Internal35_Any_Reaction","I don't think that's a good idea."
"CaerLem_Internal36_Any_Reaction","We can't do that."
"CaerLem_Darik201_Starter_Default","We need to talk."
"CaerLem_Darik202_Darik_NPC","Do we?"
"CaerLem_Darik2_Choice1_WRITTEN","Not now."
"CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_WRITTEN","You were with an expedition recently."
"CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_bailout","Well… maybe later."
"CaerLem_Darik203_Starter_Formal","Word is you took part in an expedition to the Badlands."
"CaerLem_Darik204_Starter_Normal","About this trip to the Badlands."
"CaerLem_Darik205_Darik_NPC","That's what we do, here."
"CaerLem_Darik206_Starter_Default","The Soraks attacked after you came back."
"CaerLem_Darik207_Darik_NPC","So what - I brought them here?"
"CaerLem_Darik208_Whisperer_Default","Listen, colleague… you can trust me."
"CaerLem_Darik209_Darik_NPC","You, maybe… but the others? "
"CaerLem_Darik210_Starter_Default","Did you bring something back?"
"CaerLem_Darik211_Darik_NPC","We always do, like the Scavengers."
"CaerLem_Darik212_Darik_NPC","Ask Sharp, he has tons of things brought back from there."
"CaerLem_Darik213_Starter_Default","But maybe this time, you took something special."
"CaerLem_Darik214_Darik_NPC","It's nothing of value to Soraks!"
"CaerLem_Darik215_Starter_Default","How would you know?"
"CaerLem_Darik216_Whisperer_Default","Show me, colleague."
"CaerLem_Darik217_Persuader_Default","Just trust us."
"CaerLem_Darik218_Intimidate_Default","We could simply take it."
"CaerLem_Darik219_Deceiver_Default","We can pay for it."
"CaerLem_Darik220_Defaulter_Default","We're not blaming you, but we need to know."
"CaerLem_Darik221_Darik_NPC","It's just an old book… might be of historical value."
"CaerLem_Darik222_Darik_NPC","Take it, then. And find a way to get us out of here."
"CaerLem_Darik223_Deceiver_Default","The Council will reward you if you help us."
"CaerLem_Darik224_Darik_NPC","You won't buy me with words."
"CaerLem_Darik225_Intimidate_Default","Show us, or we'll help ourselves."
"CaerLem_Darik226_Darik_NPC","I don't think so."
"CaerLem_Darik227_Darik_NPC","No."
"CaerLem_Darik228_Persuade","Trust us. We're all on the same side here."
"CaerLem_Darik229_Default_NPC","We just need to know."
"CaerLem_Darik230_Darik_NPC","Hey, what's that? Hey!"
"CaerLem_Robar2_0_Salutations","Hey, there!"
"CaerLem_Robar2_1_Salutations","Deputies."
"CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_WRITTEN","Never mind."
"CaerLem_Robar2_Choice2_WRITTEN","We want you to take the lead."
"CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_Bailout","Never mind. We'll come back later."
"CaerLem_End6_Robar_NPC","Aye."
"CaerLem_Robar21_Authority_Normal","Robar, we want you to take over from Beryl."
"CaerLem_Robar22_Robar_NPC","She'll refuse."
"CaerLem_Robar23_Authority_Normal","We'll back you up. She won't have a choice."
"CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_Refuse_NPC","No can do… it won't work."
"CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_Refuse_NPC","Right, but you deal with her if she gets mad."
"CaerLem_Robar26_Beryl_NPC","What's that?"
"CaerLem_Robar27_Authority_Normal","We believe Robar should assume command of your… remaining garrison."
"CaerLem_Robar28_Beryl_NPC","Him? Just like that?"
"CaerLem_Robar29_Authority_Normal","We order it, as deputies of the Council."
"CaerLem_Robar210_Lisbath_NPC","Bullshit."
"CaerLem_Robar211_Robar_NPC","Told ya."
"CaerLem_Robar212_Authority_Normal","Step down, Lieutenant, that's an order."
"CaerLem_Robar213_Beryl_NPC","In your dreams!"
"CaerLem_Robar214_Beryl_NPC","He'll get you killed."
"CaerLem_Robar215_Cynic_Normal","She took that well."
"CaerLem_Robar216_Any_Normal","So boss, what's the plan?"
"CaerLem_Robar217_Any_Formal","Right then, what do you say, officer?"
"CaerLem_Robar218_Robar_NPC","What the… ?"
"CaerLem_Robar219_Robar_LisbathAttacked","Lisbath!"
"CaerLem_Robar220_Robar_BerylAttacked","Lieutenant!"
"CaerLem_Beryl21_Authority_Default","Can we talk?"
"CaerLem_Beryl22_Beryl_NPC","What now?"
"CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_WRITTEN","We'll come back later."
"CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice2_WRITTEN","You should step down."
"CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_bailout","Sorry, we'll come back later."
"CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_beryl","You do that."
"CaerLem_Beryl23_Authority_Default","You need to step down."
"CaerLem_Beryl24_Beryl_NPC","Oh? And why is that?"
"CaerLem_Beryl25_Authority_Normal","This command… this situation… is clearly too much for you."
"CaerLem_Beryl26_Authority_Formal","Without wishing to cause offense, you simply lack the experience this situation requires."
"CaerLem_Beryl27_Authority_Slang","Because you're no damn use… that's why!"
"CaerLem_Beryl28_Persuasion_NPC","You think I'm happy to be in charge of this mess?"
"CaerLem_Beryl29_Intimidation_WRITTEN","We are taking command."
"CaerLem_Beryl210_Persuasion_WRITTEN","Robar should lead."
"CaerLem_Beryl211_Highclass_WRITTEN","Your ancestors would agree."
"CaerLem_Beryl212_Intimidation_Default","We are relieving you of command, in the name of the Council."
"CaerLem_Beryl213_Beryl_NPC","You… well… chain of command, I suppose."
"CaerLem_Beryl214_Beryl_NPC","Fine… you get us out of this, deputies!"
"CaerLem_Beryl215_Beryl_NPC","Go boil your head!"
"CaerLem_Beryl216_Persuasion_Default","Robar Sharp will command in your stead."
"CaerLem_Beryl217_Beryl_NPC","A former sellsword? There's a reason he's not an officer."
"CaerLem_Beryl218_Persuasion_Default","He's capable enough."
"CaerLem_Beryl219_Sellsword_Default","Mind your words."
"CaerLem_Beryl220_Highclass_Default","Your noble ancestors wouldn't like you to die rotting in there."
"CaerLem_Beryl221_Beryl_NPC","Maybe you're right."
"CaerLem_Beryl222_Beryl_NPC","I can't believe you're doing this to me!"
"CaerLem_Beryl223_Any_Formal","How dare you?"
"CaerLem_Beryl224_Any_Slang","Go boil your head!"
"CaerLem_Beryl225_Any_Normal","I don't like your tone."
"CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_NPC","Hey, what's that… ?"
"CaerLem_Beryl227_Beryl_RobarAttacked","Robar!"
"CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_LisbathAttacked","Lisbath!"
"CaerLem_DaliatKilled1_Beryl_NPC","You've got some explaining to do…"
"CaerLem_DaliatKilled2_Starter_Default","Daliat was hiding this from you."
"CaerLem_DaliatKilled3_Authority_Formal","We believe it may have attracted the Soraks."
"CaerLem_DaliatKilled4_Authority_Normal","That's probably why they attacked."
"CaerLem_DaliatKilled5_Any_Default","He refused to let it go, despite the danger."
"CaerLem_DaliatKilled6_Robar_NPC","I'm not surprised. "
"CaerLem_DaliatKilled7_Lisbath_NPC","Me neither."
"CaerLem_DaliatKilled8_Beryl_NPC","That's it? So when it's your turn to be killed, I should just say that?"
"CaerLem_DaliatKilled9_Robar_NPC","Wait… what… ?"
"CaerLem_DaliatKilled10_Robar_NPC","Lisbath!"
"CaerLem_RobarKilled1_Lisbath_NPC","Robar, no!"
"CaerLem_RobarKilled2_Beryl_NPC","I'm sorry… "
"CaerLem_RobarKilled3_Lisbath_NPC","You… this is all your fault… "
"CaerLem_RobarKilled4_Violence_Default","Soldiers die. You should know that."
"CaerLem_RobarKilled5_Maraike_Default","Maraike will take his soul to peace."
"CaerLem_RobarKilled6_Einar_Default","Don't be fooled, the Soraks are responsible… "
"CaerLem_RobarKilled7_Einar_Default","…and many others will fall if we don't report to the Council."
"CaerLem_RobarKilled8_Jugdmental_Default","Don't you think it's time to stop bickering?"
"CaerLem_RobarKilled9_Lisbath_NPC","You people - just leave me alone!"
"CaerLem_RobarKilled10_Beryl_NPC","You can't do that! "
"CaerLem_TimeToGo1_Selpfresprag_Default","He came from here! Look!"
"CaerLem_TimeToGo2_Any_Default","What's this? A secret passage?"
"CaerLem_TimeToGo3_Any_Default","From Imperial times… "
"CaerLem_TimeToGo4_Selpfresprag_Default","That was just a scout… "
"CaerLem_TimeToGo5_Selpfresprag_Default","…more will be coming."
"CaerLem_TimeToGo6_Default","They're here!"
"CaerLem_TimeToGo7_Default","They're coming back! Outside!"
"CaerLem_TimeToGo8_Selfpres_Prag_Default","We need to go! Take your stuff."
"CaerLem_TimeToGo9_Selfpres_Prag_Default","Into the secret passage, before it's too late!"
"CaerLem_LisbathKilled1_Robar_NPC","Lisbath!"
"CaerLem_LisbathKilled2_Beryl_NPC","I'm sorry… "
"CaerLem_LisbathKilled3_Robar_NPC","I should have… "
"CaerLem_LisbathKilled4_Sellsword_Default","Stay with us, brother. We're not the enemy."
"CaerLem_LisbathKilled5_Robar_NPC","Soraks… "
"CaerLem_LisbathKilled6_Beryl_NPC","Right. Who's crazy now?"
"CaerLem_LisbathKilled7_Einar_Default","We must alert the Council!"
"CaerLem_LisbathKilled8_Selfpres_Normal","We need to get out of here, that's what we need!"
"CaerLem_LisbathKilled9_Selfpres_Formal","Surviving is what matters now."
"CaerLem_LisbathKilled10_Authority_Normal","Look at that skin! It's unbelievable… "
"CaerLem_BerylKilled1_Lisbath_NPC","Oh, no… "
"CaerLem_BerylKilled2_Robar_NPC","You know she had it coming. She failed us."
"CaerLem_BerylKilled3_JudgmentalAny_Default","Happy now?"
"CaerLem_BerylKilled4_Robar_NPC","We didn't do this… the… Sorak did."
"CaerLem_BerylKilled5_Pragmatic_Default","Right, then. They are real."
"CaerLem_BerylKilled6_Einar_Default","This is unbelievable! The Council must know!"
"CaerLem_BerylKilled7_Selfpres_Default","And we need to leave, or we'll be next."
"CaerLem_BerylKilled8_Jugdmental_Default","This could have been avoided if you people hadn't wasted time bickering."
"CaerLem_BerylKilled9_Logical_Default","Let's focus here. We can't save her now, but we can still save ourselves."
"CaerLem_InTunnel1_Starter_Default","Seems quiet. "
"CaerLem_InTunnel2_Selfpres_Default","We must be cautious. Other Soraks might be scouting these caves."
"CaerLem_InTunnel3_Partner_Default","Hey, where's Daliat?"
"CaerLem_InTunnel4_Starter_Default","He was here a moment ago."
"CaerLem_InTunnel5_Selfpres_Default","The Soraks?"
"CaerLem_InTunnel6_Beryl_NPC","Daliat always had his own secrets. "
"CaerLem_InTunnel7_Beryl_NPC","I think he just went his own way."
"CaerLem_InTunnel8_Starter_Default","And the others are in the tower looking for that secret door. We don't have much choice… let's move!"
"CaerLem_InTunnel1_Beryl_NPC","Wait… "
"CaerLem_InTunnel1_Robar_NPC","Wait… "
"CaerLem_InTunnel2_Starter_Normal","Think they're Soraks?"
"CaerLem_InTunnel3_Starter_Formal","Are those Soraks?"
"CaerLem_InTunnel4_Cynicism_Default","Who else?"
"CaerLem_InTunnel5_Violence_Default","We can surprise them."
"CaerLem_InTunnel6_Selfpres_Default","Can't we sneak around?"
"CaerLem_InTunnel7_Prag_Default","From what I see, not a chance."
"CaerLem_InTunnel8_Violence_Default","All right. Tread lightly, and we all attack at once."
"CaerLem_InspectFort1_Starter_Default","What do you think?"
"CaerLem_InspectFort2_Stonecunning_Default","Typical Manacalon architecture… "
"CaerLem_InspectFort3_Stonecunning_Default","…the stonecutting is textbook… "
"CaerLem_InspectFort4_Stonecunning_Default","…using this orange stone from the mountain."
"CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Default","That's it? Orange stone?"
"CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Formal","Is that all? Stone?"
"CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Default","I'm not answering that."
"CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Formal","I won't dignify that question with an answer."
"CaerLem_InspectFort7_dunno","Maybe a dwarf could tell you about stone."
"CaerLem_InspectFort8_dunno","I guess it's… good stone."
"CaerLem_InspectFort9_dunno","Well, that was enlightening."
"CaerLem_InspectTeleporter1_Starter_Normal","What's this?"
"CaerLem_InspectTeleporter2_Starter_Formal","What is this thing?"
"CaerLem_InspectTeleporter3_Arcane_Normal","I think it was a Minor Gate."
"CaerLem_InspectTeleporter4_Arcane_Formal","I believe this was called a minor Imperial Gate."
"CaerLem_InspectTeleporter5_Arcane_Default","At its height, the Manacalon Empire had countless Gates like this."
"CaerLem_InspectTeleporter6_Arcane_Default","To magically travel through the Empire."
"CaerLem_InspectTeleporter7_Partner_Default","I don't suppose it still works?"
"CaerLem_InspectTeleporter8_Arcane_Default","Some say there are still functioning Gates."
"CaerLem_InspectTeleporter9_Commentator_Default","And this plaque? Any value?"
"CaerLem_InspectTeleporter10_Arcane_Default","Maybe. The Tower of Knowledge? Why not?"
"CaerLem_InspectCorpse1_Starter_Default","This one didn't die yesterday."
"CaerLem_InspectCorpse2_Partner_Default","What's this outfit?"
"CaerLem_InspectCorpse3_History_Default","Tirmarian."
"CaerLem_InspectCorpse4_Selfpres_Default","Who wants to open this?"
"CaerLem_InspectCorpse5_Greed_Default","You never know, there might be a fortune in there."
"CaerLem_InspectTirmarian1_Starter_Default","Can anyone read that?"
"CaerLem_InspectTirmarian2_History_Default","It's old Tirmarian."
"CaerLem_InspectTirmarian3_History_Default","It looks like part of an inquisitor's outfit."
"CaerLem_InspectTirmarian4_Partner_Default","So that's from… the tower up there?"
"CaerLem_InspectTirmarian5_Starter_Default","Maybe we're inside the tower?"
"CaerLem_InspectTirmarian6_Greed_Default","Is that gold?"
"CaerLem_InspectTirmarian7_History_Default","This is history. History, all around us!"
"CaerLem_InspectTirmarian8_Prag_Default","Take it and let's move! The Soraks don't care about history, I'm sure."
"CaerLem_End1_Starter_Default","We're safe!"
"CaerLem_End2_Partner_Default","We still have to go back to Caer Cyflen."
"CaerLem_End3_Commentator_Default","The road isn't far."
"CaerLem_End4_Starter_Normal","We'll see you back there, all right? You'll be okay?"
"CaerLem_End5_Starter_Formal","I suppose we'll meet again in Caer Cyflen? Are you good to return by yourselves?"
"CaerLem_End7_Beryl_NPC","Of course."
"CaerLem_End8_Daliat_NPC","Sure."
"CaerLem_End9_Lisbath_NPC","Yeah."
"Council01_1_NPC_Carran","Oh, here you are!"
"Council01_2_NPC_Carran","How was the mission?"
"Council01_3_Any_Practical","Successful."
"Council01_4_Any_Exalted","You won't believe it!"
"Council01_5_Any_Cynical","We almost died!"
"Council01_6_Any_ReligionEinar","We must report to the Council immediately."
"Council01_7_Any_Greedy","Not paid enough."
"Council01_8_Any_Seenitall","Business as usual."
"Council01_9_Any_Violent","Let's say we earned a few scars."
"Council01_10_NPC_follows3_Carran","Good."
"Council01_11_NPC_follows4_Carran","Let's hope the Council does, then!"
"Council01_12_NPC_follows5_Carran","Yes here you are, safe and sound."
"Council01_13_NPC_follows6_Carran","Of course. I'll inform the Council that you've returned."
"Council01_14_NPC_follows7_Carran","Who is?"
"Council01_15_NPC_follows8_Carran","I appreciate your professionalism."
"Council01_16_NPC_follows8_Carran","There's no dishonor in a few scars."
"Council01_17_Any_Practical","When can we hope for an audience?"
"Council01_18_NPC_Carran","It depends… tomorrow, if you're lucky. "
"Council01_19_NPC_Carran","Another party came back yesterday… "
"Council01_20_NPC_Carran","…and they still have to make their report, so… "
"Council01_21_NPC_Carran","…maybe they'll see you both at once."
"Council01_22_Any_Practical","We have urgent news!"
"Council01_23_Any_Practical_Slang","Listen, we can't wait around here! What we've got is big!"
"Council01_24_Any_Practical","The outpost at Caer Lem has been attacked!"
"Council01_25_Any_Practical","Almost all of the garrison was killed!"
"Council01_26_NPC_Carran","By all the gods!"
"Council01_27_NPC_Carran","Meet me in the Council chamber."
"Council01_28_NPC_Carran","I'll inform my superiors."
"Council01_29_Any_ReligionEinar","This cannot wait!"
"Council01_30_Any_ReligionEinar","The Caer Lem outpost was attacked by the Soraks!"
"Council01_31_Any_ReligionEinar","Almost all of the garrison was killed!"
"Council01_32_NPC_Carran","Soraks?"
"Council01_33_NPC_Carran","Is that a joke?"
"Council01_34_Any_Other","I'm afraid not. "
"Council01_35_Any_Other_slang","We saw them… with our own eyes!"
"Council01_36_NPC_Carran","Well, if you want to bring that to the Council… "
"Council01_37_NPC_Carran","…that's your decision."
"Council01_38_NPC_Carran","If you're so eager to look like idiots… "
"Council01_39_NPC_Carran","Meet me in the Council chamber."
"Council01_40_NPC_Speaker","The Legacy Council is now in session."
"Council01_41_NPC_Speaker","Captain Heather Merran has the floor."
"Council01_42_NPC_Ed_Morgan","Ladies and gentlemen… your Royal Highness… "
"Council01_43_NPC_Ed_Morgan","…my party and I have made a very worrying discovery."
"Council01_44_NPC_Ed_Morgan","In the Badlands… "
"Council01_45_NPC_Ed_Morgan","…near the place we call Black Hill… "
"Council01_46_NPC_Ed_Morgan","…we saw a group that we took to be Scavengers."
"Council01_47_NPC_Ed_Morgan","They attacked us right away… "
"Council01_48_NPC_Ed_Morgan","…but we were able to fight them off."
"Council01_49_NPC_Ed_Morgan","They were trying to get away with this."
"Council01_50_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir","What is it?"
"Council01_51_NPC_Ed_Morgan","This box contains a gem… A ruby, it would appear."
"Council01_52_NPC_Ed_Morgan","We have determined that it has magical properties… "
"Council01_53_NPC_Ed_Morgan","…and we believe the Council should examine it."
"Council01_54_NPC_Danantar","So we will, captain, but really… "
"Council01_55_NPC_Danantar","…is that all? "
"Council01_56_NPC_Danantar","You called an emergency meeting of the Council for a simple magical gem?"
"Council01_57_NPC_Danantar","Her Royal Highness has a busy schedule… "
"Council01_58_NPC_Princess","Please, Lord Danantar, in this chamber I'm just a student of magic."
"Council01_59_NPC_Danantar","Hear, hear!"
"Council01_60_NPC_Danantar","Anyway, Captain, the Council has a great deal of business… "
"Council01_61_NPC_Ed_Morgan","They were Soraks, our attackers… not Scavengers, not bandits… Soraks!"
"Council01_62_NPC_Danantar","… "
"Council01_63_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir","Soraks?"
"Council01_64_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Is this a joke?"
"Council01_65_NPC_Einar","The Sorr-Akkath are no laughing matter, Lord Faisech!"
"Council01_66_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Oh, you know what I mean."
"Council01_67_NPC_Princess","What do you mean, my lord?"
"Council01_68_NPC_Tower_Faisech_Faisech","How many times has the Council heard tales of these so-called Soraks?"
"Council01_69_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir","At least twenty, I'd say."
"Council01_70_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","More. Twenty-three."
"Council01_71_NPC_Danantar","More each year. It's becoming a fad."
"Council01_72_NPC_Tower_Faisech","I'm sorry, Captain, but… you are certain that you encountered Soraks?"
"Council01_73_PlayerChoice_Default","We did, too!"
"Council01_74_PlayerChoice_Exalted","It's true! They're real!"
"Council01_75_PlayerChoice_Authoritative","If you doubt her word, you can trust ours! We fought Soraks ourselves!"
"Council01_76_PlayerChoice_Practical","She's telling the truth!"
"Council01_77_NPC_Tower_Faisech","What?"
"Council01_78_NPC_Tower_Faisech","And who might you be?"
"Council01_79_NPC_LeiraKean","Some new recruits, my lord. They were sworn in quite recently."
"Council01_80_NPC_Tower_Faisech","New recruits, eh? They place too much stock in rumor, it seems."
"Council01_81_NPC_LeiraKean","They assure me that they saw Soraks as well."
"Council01_82_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","Wait!"
"Council01_83_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","Do you realize how serious this is?"
"Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1_WRITTEN","We do."
"Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2_WRITTEN","We saw them."
"Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3_WRITTEN","They attacked Caer Lem."
"Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1","We do."
"Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2","The Soraks are real! We saw them… we fought them!"
"Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3","They attacked the Caer Lem outpost… the garrison suffered severe losses!"
"Council01_87_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_1","We have never had two sightings reported at the same time."
"Council01_88_NPC_Tower_Faisech_1","Pah! Does that make this nonsense more believable?"
"Council01_89_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_2","Two sightings - independent witnesses! When will you see the truth?"
"Council01_90_NPC_Morgan_2","Yes, sir!"
"Council01_91_NPC_Morgan_2","Reptilians… fast, strong… "
"Council01_92_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","…they can climb on walls just like spiders!"
"Council01_93_PlayerSelection_Default","…they're tough, too!"
"Council01_94_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3","Caer Lem? The outpost in the Marches? "
"Council01_95_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3","What do you mean by heavy losses?"
"Council01_96_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","The Soraks took over captain Henrik… "
"Council01_97_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","…and only two of them are still alive."
"Council01_98_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","They can testify, too."
"Council01_99_NPC_Gormsdottir","Do you have any… material proof of their existence?"
"Council01_100_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","I beg your pardon?"
"Council01_101_NPC_Morgan","Like what?"
"Council01_102_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Well… A dead body, for example!"
"Council01_103_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Or even just a head?"
"Council01_104_NPC_Einar","If we go to Caer Lem, will we find the bodies of these Soraks?"
"Council01_105_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","Probably not."
"Council01_106_NPC_Morgan","They took their dead with them when they retreated."
"Council01_107_PlayerSelection_Authoritative","The bodies of their victims, too."
"Council01_108_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Hm! How very convenient!"
"Council01_109_NPC_Tower_Faisech","So you can offer us no proof of this… "
"Council01_110_NPC_Tower_Faisech","…adventurer's fable."
"Council01_111_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","And what if proof were to be brought before the Council?"
"Council01_112_NPC_Tower_Faisech","What proof? How? "
"Council01_113_NPC_Tower_Faisech","If the Soraks take away their fallen, as they say."
"Council01_114_NPC_Danantar","That's not our problem. Let them find a way."
"Council01_115_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind","These are new recruits, correct?"
"Council01_116_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind","Then let this be their new mission:"
"Council01_117_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind","Bring us the head of a Sorak, for the whole Council to see."
"Council01_118_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","That would certainly be proof, Lord Faisech, would it not?"
"Council01_119_NPC_Tower_Faisech","Oh, very well. Meanwhile, the Council will examine the gem."
"Council01_120_NPC_Tower_Faisech","If there is nothing else?"
"Council01_121_NPC_Speaker","Dean Iolair Faisech of the Tower of Knowledge calls for a recess!"
"Council01_122_NPC_Speaker","Does any member object?"
"Council01_123_NPC_Speaker","No? It is resolved, then! The Legacy Council is now in recess!"
"Council01_124_NPC_Carran","That actually went better than I expected."
"Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN","Who's the grumpy dwarf?"
"Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar_WRITTEN","We had to stand by Merran."
"Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility_WRITTEN","The Princess is bland."
"Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin_WRITTEN","They are seat-warmers."
"Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical","Who's the grumpy dwarf woman?"
"Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar","We had to stand by Merran… We know she speaks the truth."
"Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility","I must say, the Princess was… not what I expected."
"Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin","They're just a bunch of politicking seat-warmers, for all their airs and graces."
"Council01_129_NPC_Carran","Chancellor Hertha Gormsdottir, of the Guild of Antiquarians."
"Council01_130_NPC_Carran","She's… Well, yes. Quite."
"Council01_131_NPC_Carran","I'm sure she will appreciate your support."
"Council01_132_NPC_Carran","Oh? And what did you expect, exactly?"
"Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN","Someone older."
"Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Highclass_WRITTEN","Someone… a little more presentable?"
"Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Authority_WRITTEN","Someone more dignified."
"Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical","A pretty, empty-headed girl. Oh, wait… "
"Council01_134_NPC_Carran","Mind your words! She may rank low on the Council… "
"Council01_135_NPC_Carran","…but she is our sovereign, and she is well loved in the Principality."
"Council01_136_PlayerChoice_Authoritative","A more… how to put it? A more commanding personality?"
"Council01_137_NPC_Carran","Ah, well… she is young still. And she has many other qualities."
"Council01_138_PlayerChoice_Nobility","Someone more… regal?"
"Council01_139_NPC_Carran","No one is more regal than our Princess, believe me!"
"Council01_140_Player_Nobility","You know what I mean."
"Council01_141_NPC_Carran","No, actually… I don't."
"Council01_142_PlayerChoice_Urchin","A shower of weevils. Rich, clean weevils!"
"Council01_143_NPC_Carran","And your employers, let's not forget."
"Council01_144_NPC_Carran","I must admit, the Legacy Council is a… complex body."
"Council01_145_NPC_Carran","Anyway… "
"Council01_146_NPC_Carran","…some people might want to talk to you after this."
"Council01_147_NPC_Carran","Working for the Council, you are expected to be neutral."
"Council01_148_PlayerChoice_Default","But?"
"Council01_149_NPC_Carran","But you have the right to have friends."
"Council01_150_NPC_Carran","So feel free to talk to whoever you like."
"Council01_151_NPC_Carran","As long your allegiance remains to the Council as a whole."
"Council01_152_PlayerChoice_Register_Formal","You may rely on our honor."
"Council01_153_PlayerChoice_Register_normal","Of course."
"Council01_154_PlayerChoice_Register_Slang","All right, then."
"Council01_155_Merran_Thanks01","Hey, deputies - thanks for the support in there!"
"Council01_156_AnyFriendly","You're welcome, Captain. "
"Council01_157_Merran_Thanks02","So, those bastards got Henrik? Shame."
"Council01_158_Curious","You knew him?"
"Council01_159_Merran_Thanks03","Yes, indeed. I wonder who'll volunteer to retake Caer Lem now..."
"Council01_160_Friendly","The Scavengers could lead the way."
"Council01_161_Merran_Thanks04","Yeah. They'll find a bunch of hotheads to retake the fort, I'm sure."
"Council01_162_Merran_Thanks05","Stay in the light, friends!"
"Council01_163_Merran_AnyFriendly","You, too!"
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_1_Beryl_NPC","Well, if it isn't our brave saviors."
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_2_Any_Default","Good day, Lieutenant."
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_3_Aristocrat_Formal","Salutations, Lieutenant."
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_4_Beryl_NPC","I'm no longer a lieutenant. I resigned my commission. I work for my people now."
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_5_Any_Default","The Snow Alliance?"
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_6_Beryl_NPC","I will never step foot in the Badlands again."
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_7_Any_Default","I understand your reluctance."
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_8_Loyalty_Normal","Yes, well, you clearly weren't cut out for that posting."
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_9_Beryl_NPC","I've made my peace, but you aren't here to check on my welfare, are you?"
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_10_Any_Formal","No, we seek information. Before the attack, where exactly did your scout venture?"
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_11_Any_Normal","No, we have questions. Your scout? Do you know where he was before the attack? "
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_12_Beryl_NPC","You mean Daliat?"
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_13_Any_Formal","Yes, we'd like to know where he went before the Soraks attacked."
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_14_Any_Normal","Right, Daliat. Where did he go before the Soraks attacked?"
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_15_Beryl_NPC","As far as I know, there's not a name for that place or a road that leads there…"
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_16_Beryl_NPC","But I can show you on a map. It's near the ruins of an ancient tower."
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_17_Aristocrat_Formal","You have our gratitude, Lady Stonebeard."
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_18_Any_Default","Thank you, Beryl. We appreciate the help."
"AfterCouncil01_Beryl_19_Beryl_NPC","What are you thanking me for? Sending you to your death?"
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_1_Daliat_NPC","Greetings, deputies."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_2_Spy_Normal","Are you ready to come clean?"
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_3_Any_Default","Greetings, Daliat. If that's even your name."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_4_Daliat_NPC","Of course it's my name. What are you implying?"
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_5_Any_Default","Nothing at all. We just want to establish who we're talking to."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_6_Daliat_NPC","Daliat Sunbird, Scout of the Council. You know who I am!"
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_7_Any_Default","Then perhaps you can tell us the location of the ruin you came across right before the Soraks attacked."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_8_Daliat_NPC","What do you mean?"
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_9_Spy_Normal","Tell us all you know and perhaps we can convince the Council to go easy on you."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_10_Daliat_NPC","Why would they need to go easy on me? I've told you all I know."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_11_Spy_Normal","You haven't told us the location of the Manacalon ruin you found right before the Soraks attacked."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_12_Daliat_NPC","I won't take you there…"
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_13_Daliat_NPC","But I can show you the location on a map."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_14_Daliat_NPC","Of course, nothing is free."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_15_Any_Default","Indeed. Thank you."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_16_Daliat_NPC","I'm glad we could come to some agreement."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_17_Any_Default","As are we."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_18_Daliat_NPC","It's just business, after all."
"AfterCouncil01_Daliat_19_Any_Default","Right, nothing personal. Take care, Daliat."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_1_Robar_NPC","Well, look who it is. I see you survived the Council."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_2_Any_Default","We did indeed."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_3_Sellsword_Normal","Don't get your hopes up. We aren't here to offer you a job."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_4_Robar_NPC","Good, because I imagine you'd probably pay very poorly."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_5_Sellsword_Normal","You imagine correctly. I do have a question, though."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_6_Robar_NPC","To what do I owe the honor?"
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_7_Any_Default","We'd like to know where Daliat and his scouts ventured right before the attack."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_8_Robar_NPC","Looking for Soraks, are we?"
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_9_Any_Default","Possibly."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_10_Robar_NPC","You people are crazy."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_11_Robar_NPC","Here, gimme your map and I'll pinpoint the approximate location."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_12_Robar_NPC","It's near an old ruin, an ancient tower."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_13_Any_Default","Appreciate the help, Robar."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_14_Robar_NPC","Though I may have just helped you into an early grave."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_15_Any_Default","This time we'll take them by surprise."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_16_Robar_NPC","Right. Good luck with that."
"AfterCouncil01_Robar_17_Any_Default","Farewell, Robar!"
"TowerOfMagic_1_Starter_Formal","What is this?"
"TowerOfMagic_2_Starter_Normal","What's going on here?"
"TowerOfMagic_3_Starter_Slang","What the hell did we just stumble into?"
"TowerOfMagic_4_Partner_Default","These aren't Soraks. They seem human."
"TowerOfMagic_5_Starter_Default","What exactly are they doing?"
"TowerOfMagic_6_Partner_Default","What's it look like they're doing? They're digging something up."
"TowerOfMagic_7_History_Slang","Just another dusty pile of rubble from before the Cataclysm."
"TowerOfMagic_8_History_Normal","This ruin dates back to Imperial times."
"TowerOfMagic_8_History_Default","A tower of magic perhaps, owned by one of the masters of Manacalon's Arcaneum."
"TowerOfMagic_9_Starter_Default","Who are these people? Scavengers?"
"TowerOfMagic_10_Partner_Default","Hard to say. I see no tent or flag signifying their allegiance."
"TowerOfMagic_11_Authority_Default","Well, there is one way to find out."
"TowerOfMagic_12_Selfpres_Default","Perhaps we should sneak a little closer."
"TowerOfMagic_13_Friendliness_Default","Or simply walk in and see how friendly they are."
"TowerOfMagicWorkers01","Alert!"
"TowerOfMagicWorkers02_Normal","All right - no talking, then… "
"TowerOfMagicWorkers03_Formal","Looks like there won't be any parley… "
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_1_Starter_Default","So what do you think?"
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_2_Partner_Normal","Humans."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_3_Partner_Slang","They look like people to me."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_4_Partner_Formal","I see nothing to indicate they are reptilian."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_5_Partner_Normal","Unless, they have been transmogrified and are in disguise."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_6_Starter_Default","What's that symbol there?"
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_7_Partner_Default","The tattoo?"
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_8_Partner_Default","Looks like an A."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_9_Commentator_Default","They all have it."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_10_Cynical_Normal","Guess they're all part of the same club."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_11_Cynical_Formal","Perhaps it's a crude marker that indicates their allegiance. "
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_12_Pragmatic_Default","Well, there's no reason to assume it signifies something sinister."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_13_Starter_Default","Do you think it has anything to do with the Soraks?"
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_14_History_Default","""A"" could stand for Arivad."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_15_History_Default","One of the many names of Sorr-Tarr, the Sorak God."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_16_Anyother_Default","Are you kidding me?"
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_17_Anyother_Default","That's not good."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_18_Starter_Default","At least we know we're in the right place."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_19_Authority_Default","Should we see what they're doing here?"
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_20_Selpres_Default","Yes, but we should also keep an eye out for any stray Soraks."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_21_Violence_Default","If a Sorak shows up, we need to cut off its head."
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_1_Starter_Default","Please don't kill me."
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_2_Starter_Default","What are you doing here?"
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_3_Starter_Default","I'm just a worker."
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_4_Starter_Default","Are you tattooed with an A?"
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_5_Starter_Default","I… you don't understand…"
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_6_Starter_Default","Are you one of them?"
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_7_Starter_Default","One of what? I'm just trying to survive. "
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_8_Starter_Default","I had no choice."
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_9_Written_Kill","You must die."
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_10_Written_LetLive","Get out of here."
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_11_Written_Tatoo","Tell us about the tattoo."
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_12_Written_Imps","Are the Soraks around?"
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_13_Choice_Kill","He is a Sorak slave! We should put him out of his misery!"
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_14_Choice_LetLive","Run! Run for your life! "
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_15_Choice_Tatoo","What does the tattoo signify?"
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_16_Choice_Imps","Are the Soraks close by?"
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_17_Starter_Default","It's… I can't…"
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_18_Starter_Default","He's dead. How is that possible? "
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_19_Starter_Default","How is any of this possible?"
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_20_Starter_Default","He was doomed from the start."
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_21_Starter_Default","They're here. They're close…"
"TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_22_Starter_Default","If they know that I…"
"TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor1_Starter_NPC","Another statue… "
"TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor2_Partner_Normal","These guys really loved themselves."
"TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor3_Partner_Formal","These Manacalon wizards were quite fond of themselves."
"TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor4_History_Normal","Now, this is an Emperor."
"TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor5_History_Normal","A famous one, too? Lerithir Imradir… "
"TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor6_History_Normal","…he was Emperor at the time of the Cataclysm."
"TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor7_Partner_Normal","Good job managing the trouble, mister."
"TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor8_Partner_Formal","He made history, but not the way he would have wanted."
"TowerOfMagicRunes_1_Arcana_Default","This place is astounding."
"TowerOfMagicRunes_2_Partner_Default","What kind of runes are those?"
"TowerOfMagicRunes_3_Arcana_Default","Enchanted runes. From the ancient Imperial period. "
"TowerOfMagicRunes_4_Arcana_Default","It is said they had eight schools of magic."
"TowerOfMagicRunes_5_Arcana_Default","Each is represented here. All as equals."
"TowerOfMagicRunes_6_Pragmatic_Formal","We weren't sent here to find runes. We were sent to find Soraks. "
"TowerOfMagicRunes_7_Pragmatic_Slang","Yeah, you can tell that to the Soraks right before they cut us to frickin' pieces."
"TowerOfMagicRunes_8_Pragmatic_Normal","We're not here for runes, we're here for Soraks."
"TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_1_Starter_Default","That was… unexpected."
"TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_2_Partner_Default","This place is topsy-turvy."
"TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_3_Partner_Default","Magic from a time long forgotten. "
"TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_4_Joker_Default","Remind me not to take a dump in that hole."
"TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_5_Prag_Default","Do you really have to make jokes?"
"TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_6_Joker_Default","Yeah. It's in my contract. Did Carran not tell you?"
"TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_7_FormalJoker_Default","Something funny suddenly comes to mind…"
"TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_8_Prag_Default","Can you keep it to yourself?"
"TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_9_Starter_Default","Might be good to remember what these blue currents can do."
"TowerOfMagicDoor_1_Starter_Default","We did it!"
"TowerOfMagicDoor_2_Partner_Default","Was that insane puzzle the work of some long dead Manacalon wizard?"
"TowerOfMagicDoor_3_Joke_Default","Probably. Even from the tomb that magical arsehole is messing with us.  "
"TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_1_Starter_Default","They didn't die easily."
"TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_2_Starter_Default","Worthy foes, indeed."
"TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_3_Partner_Formal","Thankfully, we prevailed."
"TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_4_Partner_Slang","Got every one of those ugly bastards."
"TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_5_Partner_Normal","They bleed just like we do."
"TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_6_Pragmatic_Default","Now we just need one of their bloody heads."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_1_Commentator_Default","Would you look at this?"
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_2_Starter_Default","A crown of some kind?"
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_3_Partner_Default","They seemed to keep their distance from it."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_4_Selpres_Default","Maybe it's cursed."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_5_PlayerChoice_Default","Look what I found."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_6_Educated_Default","Let me take a look."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_7_Default_Default","What language is this?"
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_8_Tirmarian_Default","Looks like ancient Tirmarian."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_9_Tirmarian_Default","If you find it, send for… this appears to be a name."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_10_Starter_Slang","Is this the language of those damned lizards? "
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_11_Starter_Normal","That has to be a Sorak name."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_12_Partner_Default","They were protecting it, so it must be valuable - to them, at least."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_13_Selpres_Default","Take it then. "
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_14_Starter_Default","Whew, I was worried it might be booby trapped."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_15_Partner_Default","Perhaps we should rest before we head back."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_16_Selpres_Default","I say we go."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_17_Selpres_Default","Before the owner of that unpronounceable name shows his ugly face."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default","The mission is done after all."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_19_Selpres_Default","Is it? Did someone cut off a Sorak's head?"
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_20_Selpres_Default","All right, then - I'll do it!"
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_21_Pragmatic_Default","The sooner we go, the sooner we can get back to Caer Cyflen."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_22_Starter_Default","After you, friends."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrownWRITTENLINE","Take the Crown"
"TowerOfMagicBook_1_Starter_Default","Interesting."
"TowerOfMagicBook_2_Spellcaster_Default","It's in remarkable condition considering how long it's been here."
"TowerOfMagicBook_3_Starter_Default","Do you think it has magical properties?"
"TowerOfMagicBook_4_Spellcaster_Slang","By Arun's bones! I think it's a spellbook."
"TowerOfMagicBook_5_Spellcaster_Default","A spellbook that predates the Cataclysm."
"TowerOfMagicBook_6_Starter_Default","And I should care because?"
"TowerOfMagicBook_7_Spellcaster_Formal","Who knows what it might contain."
"TowerOfMagicBook_8_Spellcaster_Default","A long-forgotten spell. A valuable secret."
"TowerOfMagicBook_9_Spellcaster_Default","But it looks like it's locked."
"TowerOfMagicBook_10_Starter_Default","Take it. Perhaps someone in Caer Cyflen will know how to open it."
"TowerOfMagicBook_11_Spellcaster_Default","First things first. We have a mission to complete."
"TowerOfMagicBook_12_Spellcaster_Formal","Indeed, but we have more pressing matters to attend to first."
"TowerOfMagicBook_13_Spellcaster_Slang","Yeah, but right now we have more important shit to take care of."
"TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_1_Starter_Default","Fancy."
"TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_2_Starter_Default","Beautiful craftsmanship."
"TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_3_Starter_Default","She looks like an empress."
"TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_4_History_Default","She doesn't bear the proper regalia. Not for a Manacalon."
"TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_5_History_Default","More likely she was a wizard, a master of the Arcaneum."
"TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_6_Starter_Default","Could this have been her home?"
"TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_7_History_Default","Possibly."
"TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_8_Joker_Default","If it was, she sure let it go to hell. What a packrat. "
"TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_9_Joker_Default","Her bones are probably buried somewhere under all these frickin' books."
"TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_10_Starter_Default","You are an idiot."
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_1_Starter_Default","You see that?"
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_2_Partner_Default","Is that a Sorak?"
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_3_History_Default","Don't be ridiculous. This is pre-Cataclysm."
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4_History_Default","Before anyone knew what a Sorak even was."
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_5_History_Default","It's a dragon."
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_6_Starter_Default","It's no bigger than a man."
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_7_Starter_Slang","No shit?"
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_8_Starter_Normal","If you say so."
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_9_Partner_Normal","I don't think so."
"TowerOfMagicPillar_1_Starter_Default","Is this one of those rocks that…"
"TowerOfMagicPillar_2_Partner_Default","Nope. This place is insane."
"TowerOfMagicPillar_3_Partner_Default","In the Badlands…"
"TowerOfMagicPillar_4_Starter_Default","I know… expect the unexpected. "
"TowerOfMagicUselessLever_1_Starter_Default","Well, that didn't do a damn thing. "
"TowerOfMagicUselessLever_2_Cynical_Default","Did you really think that would open the door?"
"TowerOfMagicUselessLever_3_Violence_Default","I need to break some frickin' heads!"
"TowerOfMagicUselessLever_4_Pragmatism_Default","We need to be smarter about this. Think it through."
"TowerOfMagicUselessLever_5_Greed_Default","We better get out of this with some gold in our pockets."
"TowerOfMagicUselessLever_6_SelfPres_Default","Your faces are not the last faces I want to see."
"TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_1_Starter_Default","Stay hidden. They're here."
"TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_2_Partner_Default","Soraks?"
"TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_3_Starter_Default","What else could they be?"
"TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_4_Partner_Normal","You ready to do this?"
"TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_5_Partner_Formal","This is it, friends. Stay strong."
"TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_6_Starter_Default","Get in position…"
"TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_7_Starter_Default","…hit 'em hard and take 'em by surprise."
"TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_8_Partner_Default","Ready."
"CrownOwned_1_Partner_Normal","You look a little pale. Is something wrong?"
"CrownOwned_2_Partner_Formal","Are you feeling poorly? You seem a bit pasty-faced."
"CrownOwned_3_Bearer_Default","I don't feel too good. "
"CrownOwned_4_Cynical_Selfpres_Default","I knew that old Crown was cursed."
"CrownOwned_5_Cynical_Selfpres_Slang","Shit, I knew that hunk of junk was cursed."
"CrownOwned_6_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal","Just as I feared. The crown is Cursed."
"CrownOwned_7_Partner_Default","You don't know that."
"CrownOwned_8_Cynical_Selpres_Default","Just get rid of it."
"CrownOwned_9_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal","Perhaps we should leave it."
"CrownOwned_10_Bearer_Default","No, we need it."
"CrownOwned_11_Partner_Default","Need it? For what?"
"CrownOwned_12_Bearer_Default","For its power. I can feel it. Deep inside."
"CrownOwned_13_Friendly_Default","Are you okay?"
"CrownOwned_14_Bearer_Default","I just need to rest for a bit."
"CrownOwned_15_Any1_Default","Yeah, I'm not feeling too good either."
"CrownOwned_16_Any2_Default","I'm exhausted as well."
"CrownOwned_17_Cynical_Selpres_Default","Maybe the curse has affected us all."
"CrownOwned_18_Partner_Default","Stop it. Don't be ridiculous."
"CrownOwned_19_Friendly_Default","Fine, let's rest for a while. Set up camp."
"CrownOwned_20_Friendly_Formal","I propose we set up camp and get some rest."
"BackWithCrown_1_Pragmatic_Default","We did it! We brought back proof!"
"BackWithCrown_2_Pragmatic_Formal","Against all odds, we have recovered proof that Soraks do exist."
"BackWithCrown_3_Friendly_Default","How do you feel?"
"BackWithCrown_4_Bearer_Default","Better."
"BackWithCrown_5_Friendly_Default","Maybe that sickness was nothing."
"BackWithCrown_6_Friendly_Formal","It might have been a simple fever, after all."
"BackWithCrown_7_Pragmatic_Default","What about the Crown?"
"BackWithCrown_8_Pragmatic_Default","You know the Council will probably take it."
"BackWithCrown_9_Bearer_Default","No!"
"BackWithCrown_10_Pragmatic_Default","We can't hide the fact that we found it with the Soraks."
"BackWithCrown_11_Pragmatic_Slang","We can't bullshit them, it's got to be a Sorak thing."
"BackWithCrown_12_Bearer_Default","It's our loot! Ours!"
"BackWithCrown_13_Pragmatic_Default","We have to declare anything of historical value… "
"BackWithCrown_14_Pragmatic_Default","…and they have the right to buy it."
"BackWithCrown_15_Bearer_Default","And if it's priceless?"
"BackWithCrown_16_Cynical_Default","Come on! They can do whatever they want."
"BackWithCrown_17_Bearer_Default","Sure."
"BackWithCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default","I guess we'll see."
"BackWithCrown_19_Pragmatic_Formal","We must wait and see, and hope for the best."
"BackWithCrown_20_Cynical_Default","Who fought the Soraks - us or them?"
"BackWithCrown_21_Cynical_Normal","They'd better remember that we fought the Soraks for this."
"BackWithCrown_22_Cynical_Formal","We might want to remind them that they were wrong about the Soraks."
"Council02_1_1_Partner_Default","Lord Carran!"
"Council02_1_2_Carran_NPC","Ah - deputies! "
"Council02_1_2_2_Carran_NPC","I see you found some nice shiny loot."
"Council02_1_3_Carran_NPC","So have you brought us the head of a Sorak?"
"Council02_1_4_Partner_Default","One head, slightly damaged."
"Council02_1_5_Carran_NPC","Maraike preserve us! I'm sorry I asked!"
"Council02_1_6_Partner_Default","At least it's dead. You should have seen it alive."
"Council02_1_7_Carran_NPC","I can only imagine."
"Council02_1_8_Partner_Default","When's the next Council meeting?"
"Council02_1_9_Carran_NPC","When? Now, of course!"
"Council02_1_10_Carran_NPC","The rumor of your return has already reached the Palace."
"Council02_1_11_Carran_NPC","They're waiting for you."
"Council02_1_12_Partner_Default","They are?"
"Council02_1_13_Carran_NPC","Well, more for… this. But come on!"
"Council02_1_14_Merton_NPC","Now, there's a trophy."
"Council02_1_15_Merton_NPC","And by the way, who's crazy now?"
"Council02_1_16_Default_Default","All right, you were right and we were wrong. They do exist. Happy now?"
"Council02_1_17_Merton_NPC","Kid, I've seen more than anyone in this town, yet nobody seems to believe me."
"Council02_1_18_Cynical_Default","Maybe it's a curse."
"Council02_1_19_Merton_NPC","The curse of being surrounded by idiots… "
"Council02_1_20_Carran_NPC","If you don't mind, Merton, we have business to attend to."
"Council02_1_21_Merton_NPC","Right. Say hello to the old lady for me, Carran!"
"Council02_1_22_Default_Default","Who's this guy again?"
"Council02_1_23_Merton_NPC","Arwin Merton. He used to be a legend - the first Scavenger, they say."
"Council02_1_24_Merton_NPC","But now - well, you can see for yourself."
"Council02_1_25_Curious_Default","Who's this old lady?"
"Council02_1_26_Merton_NPC","Just ignore him."
"Council02_1_27_Merton_NPC","Let's go."
"Council02_2_1_EinarBoss_NPC","Your thoughts, Dean Faisech?"
"Council02_2_2_Towerboss_NPC","I… well… it looks very much as the scriptures describe."
"Council02_2_3_Danantar_NPC","Well, then - it seems we have a problem."
"Council02_2_4_EinarBoss_NPC","It's a disaster! We all know what the Sorr-Akkath did on Tirmar!"
"Council02_2_5_Partner_Default","There's something else."
"Council02_2_6_Danantar_NPC","What?"
"Council02_2_7_Antiquarian_NPC","A Crown?"
"Council02_2_8_Towerboss_NPC","Interesting. A very nice find."
"Council02_2_9_Partner_Default","We don't want to sell it."
"Council02_2_10_Antiquarian_NPC","Why not? You know we pay well."
"Council02_2_11_Partner_Default","We want to keep it."
"Council02_2_12_Arcaneum_NPC","I'd like to take a look at it, though."
"Council02_2_13_Partner_Default","… "
"Council02_2_14_Authority_Default","Come on, let them take a look."
"Council02_2_15_Arcaneum_NPC","Thank you."
"Council02_2_16_Danantar_NPC","Any ideas?"
"Council02_2_17_Arcaneum_NPC","It's quite massive… clearly Imperial in style… "
"Council02_2_18_Towerboss_NPC","These runes remind me of the Imperial schools of magic… "
"Council02_2_19_Antiquarian_NPC","I have a spell I'd like to cast on this."
"Council02_2_20_Princess_NPC","My lords! This deputy is clearly unwell!"
"Council02_2_21_Danantar_NPC","What?"
"Council02_3_1_Bearer_Default","What happened?"
"Council02_3_2_Friendly_Default","You passed out."
"Council02_3_3_Bearer_Default","Where are we?"
"Council02_3_4_Friendly_Default","The Temple of Einar."
"Council02_3_5_Friendly_Default","Marshal Beric Sunblaze himself invited us to stay here."
"Council02_3_6_Pragmatic_Default","We certainly made an impression on the Council."
"Council02_3_7_Pragmatic_Default","They believe you're attuned to the Crown… "
"Council02_3_8_Pragmatic_Default","…that you can't be separated from it."
"Council02_3_9_Bearer_Default","What? So it is cursed?"
"Council02_3_10_Cynical_Default","They're not sure. All these big brains, and they're stumped."
"Council02_3_11_Cynical_Default","They cast spells on the crown, on you… "
"Council02_3_12_Pragmatic_Default","Between that and the Soraks, we caused quite a fuss out there."
"Council02_3_13_Pragmatic_Default","They'll reconvene the Council when you're ready."
"Council02_3_14_Pragmatic_Default","But trust me, there's a lot of people who want to talk to you first."
"Tower_Dialog_01_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","It's an honor, deputies."
"Tower_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default","Who are you?"
"Tower_Dialog_01_3_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","My name is Maddy Greenisle. I work for the Tower of Knowledge."
"Tower_Dialog_01_4_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","I'm just a junior aide in the Council…"
"Tower_Dialog_01_5_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","…but if you ever need to contact my superiors without going through official channels…"
"Tower_Dialog_01_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","…just see me at the Tower, downtown."
"Tower_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Selfpres_Default","Why the sudden interest in us?"
"Tower_Dialog_01_8_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","You proved yourselves in the Badlands…"
"Tower_Dialog_01_9_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","…and we in the Tower of Knowledge value skilled adventurers."
"Tower_Dialog_01_10_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","If you find anything of historical value, we'll pay well…"
"Tower_Dialog_01_11_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","And if things go well, we might share some of our own secrets."
"Tower_Dialog_01_12_Authority_Default","All right - we'll think about it."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_1_HalmanSummer_NPC","Greetings, Sorak slayers!"
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_2_Friendly_Default","Hello."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_3_HalmanSummer_NPC","I am Halman Summer of the Guild of Antiquarians."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_4_HalmanSummer_NPC","I am instructed to invite you to visit us at the Embassy of the Snow Alliance."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_5_Lawfulness_Default","You're based at an embassy? I thought the Council was neutral."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_6_HalmanSummer_NPC","We don't have a house of our own in Caer Cyflen - unlike the Tower of Knowledge…"
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_7_HalmanSummer_NPC","…how about that for neutrality?"
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_8_HalmanSummer_NPC","Anyway, we'd be interested in any antiquities you might bring back. "
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_9_HalmanSummer_NPC","We pay very well, even for things you might think are worthless."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_10_Cynical_Default","Like the Scavengers?"
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_11_HalmanSummer_NPC","The Scavengers? They'd sell an antique Emperor's sword for its metal value."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_12_HalmanSummer_NPC","But we can offer more than gold."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_13_HalmanSummer_NPC","Antique magical items, for instance. You'll never find their like elsewhere."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_01_14_Friendly_Default","Good to know. Thanks for the invitation."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Can I ask for a minute of your time, deputies?"
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_2_Player_Authority","We're in kind of a hurry."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I know. I won't delay you long."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_4_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","My name is Heddlon Surespell. I represent the Arcaneum."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_5_AnyNotElf_Default","And the Arcaneum belongs to the New Empire. Do you really want to be seen talking to us?"
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","My business is magic, not politics. And no, I have no quarrel with you."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","You may not see us Imperials as friends, but we take the Council very seriously."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_8_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","We are particularly interested in anything from the Old Empire that you might find in the Badlands."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Anything from the Manacalon-era Arcaneum, even more so."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_10_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Of course we'd pay you handsomely for this Crown, but I know that is not possible."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default","You're smarter than you look."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Also quite indifferent to mockery."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_13_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Anyway, we have an unrivaled trove of magical and other knowledge."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_14_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Think it over. You can find me at the Gravekeep's Cask."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_15_Lawful_Default","Really? Not at the embassy?"
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","What can I say? I love Martel's beer. Even though it tastes like donkey piss…"
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_17_Selfpres_Default","What? How did he… ?"
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_18_Selfpres_Default","That was our joke, the first day we met. Was he spying on us?"
"Arcaneum_Dialog_01_19_Pragmatic_Default","Maybe he just agrees about the taste."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Would you have a moment, deputies?"
"Danantar_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default","All right, but make it quick."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_3_JorielFoxeye_NPC","I'll do my best."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_4_JorielFoxeye_NPC","I am Joriel Foxeye, from the Circle of Danantar."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_5_Nosy_Default","The same magic school where the Princess studies?"
"Danantar_Dialog_01_6_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Exactly. "
"Danantar_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Default","Is she a good student? A powerful wizard?"
"Danantar_Dialog_01_8_JorielFoxeye_NPC","That's not for me to say - and you seemed to be in a rush?"
"Danantar_Dialog_01_9_Nosy_Default","Fine."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_10_JorielFoxeye_NPC","I just want you to know that our grand master Edvan Danantar has noticed you."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default","He talked a lot, for sure."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_12_JorielFoxeye_NPC","He's a man of great authority."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_13_JorielFoxeye_NPC","He'd like you to know that our doors are open to you if you'd care to visit us."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_13_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC","You can find me at Sunblaze Court."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_14_Pragmatic_Default","Interested in Badlands treasures, I suppose, like everyone else?"
"Danantar_Dialog_01_15_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Well, if you ever come across old spellbooks or spell scrolls, we'd love to see them."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_16_JorielFoxeye_NPC","In return, we have the largest collection of spells and potion recipes you could ever hope to see."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_17_Nosy_Default","More than the Arcaneum?"
"Danantar_Dialog_01_18_JorielFoxeye_NPC","They would disagree - but yes."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_19_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Now, if you were to prefer feeding the New Empire's wizards with more magical knowledge than the Principality…"
"Danantar_Dialog_01_20_JorielFoxeye_NPC","…that would be troubling to many on the Council."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_21_Lawful_Default","Neutrality means we don't treat you any differently than we treat them."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_22_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Of course. Neutrality is the rule."
"Danantar_Dialog_01_23_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Good day to you, deputies."
"Council02_4_1_TowerBoss_NPC","Ah - our crownbearer is up again!"
"Council02_4_2_Speaker_NPC","Honorable Council Members! Please take your seats!"
"Council02_4_3_Speaker_NPC","Lord Danantar has the floor."
"Council02_4_4_Danantar_NPC","Thank you."
"Council02_4_5_Danantar_NPC","I have confirmed that our deputy is indeed magically attuned to the Crown."
"Council02_4_6_Danantar_NPC","It is… an uncommonly powerful attunement, unlike anything I've seen."
"Council02_4_7_Danantar_NPC","I strongly recommend against forcing a separation."
"Council02_4_8_Speaker_NPC","Chancellor Gormsdottir?"
"Council02_4_9_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","With the Council's permission, I'd like to try a little experiment."
"Council02_4_10_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","I have here the gem that Captain Merran recovered recently."
"Council02_4_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","I have reason to believe that it might be… "
"Council02_4_12_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","As I suspected! It belongs to the Crown!"
"Council02_4_13_Arcaneum_NPC","What have you done?"
"Council02_4_14_EinarBoss_NPC","Commander! Take Her Royal Highness to safety!"
"Council02_4_15_Princess_NPC","Wait!"
"Council02_5_1_Arcaneum_NPC","Are you going to faint again?"
"Council02_5_2_Crownbearer_WRITTEN","I just had a… vision, I guess it was."
"Council02_5_3_Crownbearer_WRITTEN","It's nothing."
"Council02_5_4_Crownbearer_WRITTEN","I must… find the other gems."
"Council02_5_5_Crownbearer_Answer","I just had a vision."
"Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Answer","It's nothing."
"Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Answer","The Crown wants the other gems back."
"Council02_5_5_Danantar_NPC","A vision? In an instant?"
"Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Default","I was fighting Soraks - but I wasn't myself."
"Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Default","Then… who were you?"
"Council02_5_8_Crownbearer_Default","A paladin… powerful… "
"Council02_5_9_Crownbearer_Default","…from Tirmar."
"Council02_5_10_Danantar_NPC","That is… unsettling."
"Council02_5_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","Honorable delegates, I suggest we focus on the Soraks for now."
"Council02_5_12_Danantar_NPC","I concur."
"Council02_5_13_EinarBoss_NPC","What about this artifact? The other gems?"
"Council02_5_14_TowerBoss_NPC","What?"
"Council02_5_15_Crownbearer_Default","I think I can find them. I can… feel them."
"Council02_5_16_EinarBoss_NPC","You said it wasn't sentient."
"Council02_5_17_Danantar_NPC","This is old Manacalon magic. Anything is possible."
"Council02_5_18_Danantar_NPC","Let the crownbearer and the other deputies follow that quest."
"Council02_5_19_Danantar_NPC","Find the other gems if you can, but keep us informed."
"Council02_5_20_Danantar_NPC","In the meantime, we will formulate a response to the Soraks."
"Council02_5_21_AntiquarianBoss_NPC","Let's vote. Delegates - do you agree?"
"Council02_5_22_All_NPC","Aye!"
"Council02_5_23_Speaker_NPC","Your Royal Highness?"
"Council02_5_24_Princess_NPC","Oh? pardon me. Yes, I concur… "
"Council02_5_25_Speaker_NPC","To which proposition, Your Highness?"
"Council02_5_26_Princess_NPC","I mean, aye. They should go and find the diamonds - the gems."
"Council02_5_27_Speaker_NPC","So resolved! Let it be recorded!"
"Council02_5_28_Speaker_NPC","Thank you, honored delegates. The Council is now in recess."
"Council02_5_29_Char1_Default","What was that?"
"Council02_5_30_Char1_Default","You had a vision?"
"Council02_5_31_Char2_Default","What do you mean the Crown wants its missing gems?"
"Council02_5_32_Crownbearer_Default","I… I can't explain. I just feel it. Anyway, we have a new mission."
"Council02_5_33_Char3_Default","All right, then. So where are we going, crownbearer?"
"Council02_5_34_Crownbearer_Default","I think… the Crown knows."
"Merton_01_1_Merton_NPC","Look who's here! The Sorak hunters themselves!"
"Merton_01_2_Any_Default","It's Merton, right? Arwin Merton?"
"Merton_01_3_Merton_NPC","Damn right!"
"Merton_01_4_Any_Default","First Scavenger? Where does that come from?"
"Merton_01_5_Merton_NPC","Long story, kid."
"Merton_01_6_Merton_NPC","Short version: When we started crossing the Marches to the Badlands, I was one of the first."
"Merton_01_7_Merton_NPC","Now, I'm just the ugliest one still standing."
"Merton_01_8_Any_Default","What should we know about the Badlands? Any advice?"
"Merton_01_9_Merton_NPC","Bring a good cleric with good healing spells. You'll need them."
"Merton_01_10_Any_Default","You're a legend. Why do you seem so sour?"
"Merton_01_11_Merton_NPC","Sour? It's this ale that's sour, that's all."
"Merton_01_12_Merton_NPC","The high and mighty Council, paying clueless kids like you to go and get killed in the Badlands."
"Merton_01_13_Merton_NPC","But they're not asking good old Arwin - nooo. Go figure."
"Merton_01_14_Merton_NPC","It's because I got them figured out."
"Merton_01_15_Any_Default","Figured out how?"
"Merton_01_16_Merton_NPC","This Legacy Council is full of it."
"Merton_01_17_Merton_NPC","Acting all united and lovey-dovey while they plot to rob each other."
"Merton_01_18_Merton_NPC","Wouldn't surprise me if some of them were even Soraks in disguise. You know they can shapeshift."
"Merton_01_19_Any_Default","Uh - okay…"
"Merton_01_20_Merton_NPC","Hey, I was right about them hiding in the Badlands, wasn't I?"
"Council03_1_LeiraKean_NPC","Honorable members of the Council, please be seated!"
"Council03_2_LeiraKean_NPC","The Legacy Council is now in session!"
"Council03_3_LeiraKean_NPC","Lord Keenmind has the floor."
"Council03_4_Keenmind_NPC","Honorable members of the Council, we at the Arcaneum… "
"Council03_5_Keenmind_NPC","…have gathered crucial information about this Crown."
"Council03_6_Keenmind_NPC","This is indeed the Crown of the Magister, belonging to Kaseinax, Eternal Soul of the Eight Traditions… "
"Council03_7_Keenmind_NPC","…ninth and last Magister of the Manacalon Arcaneum."
"Council03_8_Keenmind_NPC","At the time, there were eight masters of magic, one for each of the old schools."
"Council03_9_Keenmind_NPC","In time of need, each of the masters lent their gem to the Magister, the head of the Arcaneum."
"Council03_10_Keenmind_NPC","Placed in the Crown, they granted additional powers… "
"Council03_11_Keenmind_NPC","…that enabled the Magister to cast spells or perform rituals of incredible power."
"Council03_12_Keenmind_NPC","Such as the closing of the Rift from Tirmar."
"Council03_13_All_NPC","overlapping murmurs"
"Council03_14_Keenmind_NPC","Indeed."
"Council03_15_Keenmind_NPC","Now… there is some debate about… "
"Council03_16_Keenmind_NPC","…whether the Crown, with all its gems… "
"Council03_17_Keenmind_NPC","…could possibly open another Rift…"
"Council03_18_All_NPC","overlapping protestations"
"Council03_19_Keenmind_NPC","…or even reopen the previous one."
"Council03_20_Towerboss_NPC","Nonsense! The Rift has been closed for a millennium!"
"Council03_21_Danantar_NPC","Solasta paid a high enough price for that!"
"Council03_22_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Have you been to the Badlands recently?"
"Council03_23_LeiraKean_NPC","Order!"
"Council03_24_LeiraKean_NPC","Marshal Sunblaze has the floor."
"Council03_25_Einarboss_NPC","For our part, now that the existence of Sorr-Akkath on Solasta has been confirmed…"
"Council03_26_Einarboss_NPC","…we have gathered proof that they are operating everywhere in the Eastern Kingdoms."
"Council03_27_Einarboss_NPC","Including here, in the Principality of Masgarth."
"Council03_28_Towerboss_NPC","Impossible!"
"Council03_29_Einarboss_NPC","The Soraks are looking for the Crown and its gems. That cannot be a coincidence."
"Council03_30_Antiquariansboss_NPC","A powerful artifact, certainly - but reopening the Rift? "
"Council03_31_Antiquariansboss_NPC","It took all the gods of Tirmar to open it!"
"Council03_32_Einarboss_NPC","No one knows for sure what the Crown can do."
"Council03_33_Keenmind_NPC","It's a theory."
"Council03_34_Keenmind_NPC","As you know, it protects itself from our divination spells… "
"Council03_35_Keenmind_NPC","…that is one of its mysterious powers."
"Council03_36_Towerboss_NPC","Then why would the Soraks think they know better?"
"Council03_37_Einarboss_NPC","Because they're Soraks!"
"Council03_38_Einarboss_NPC","Their people, their culture - they must have been obsessing about this for a thousand years!"
"Council03_39_Einarboss_NPC","While we spent that time fighting each other, they had to stick together and hide to survive."
"Council03_40_Towerboss_NPC","Fables and conjectures!"
"Council03_41_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Perhaps."
"Council03_42_Einarboss_NPC","But can we take the risk?"
"Council03_43_Danantar_NPC","The Crown must be secured!"
"Council03_44_Antiquariansboss_NPC","The Crown belongs to those who found it. Those are the rules."
"Council03_45_Antiquariansboss_NPC","The quest for the gems should be completed."
"Council03_46_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Only this way can we learn more about the Crown and its powers."
"Council03_47_Towerboss_NPC","These deputies - well, they're not strong enough! No offense."
"Council03_48_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Tell that to the Crown. And they've done well enough so far, wouldn't you say?"
"Council03_49_Towerboss_NPC","This is nonsense!"
"Council03_50_Princess_NPC","Maybe the deputies would like to speak."
"Council03_51_Princess_NPC","After all, they are members of the Council now, aren't they?"
"Council03_52_Authority_Normal_WRITTEN","We'll continue the quest."
"Council03_55_Greed_Default_WRITTEN","Give us weapons."
"Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default_WRITTEN","You should trust us more."
"Council03_61_Selfishness_Default_WRITTEN","The Crown is ours."
"Council03_52_Authority_Normal","We feel perfectly able to continue searching for the gems."
"Council03_53_Authority_Formal","With all due respect, we are confident that we can fulfill this quest ourselves."
"Council03_54_Authority_Slang","We got this. Really, it's under control."
"Council03_55_Greed_Default","You can give us the means to be stronger. Weapons, armor, maybe some spells?"
"Council03_56_Greed_Formal","May we be so bold as to ask your for material support? Weapons, armor, or spells, for instance?"
"Council03_57_Greed_Slang","We'd be stronger if you tossed a few things our way. You know - weapons, armor, spells - that sort of thing."
"Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default","You may trust that we are devoted to this quest. We are well aware of its importance."
"Council03_59_Lawfulness_Formal","We are fully devoted to the quest, and perfectly aware of its vital importance."
"Council03_60_Lawfulness_Slang","We get it - this is big. We won't let you down!"
"Council03_61_Selfishness_Default","We didn't change our mind about the Crown - it's ours!"
"Council03_62_Selfishness_Formal","We must reiterate that we have no intention of giving up the Crown."
"Council03_63_Selfishness_Slang","Let's be clear. The Crown is ours, and it stays ours."
"Council03_64_Danantar_NPC","Confidence? I like that."
"Council03_65_Towerboss_NPC","Preposterous!"
"Council03_66_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Five more gems to find. Do you even have a lead?"
"Council03_67_Authority_Default","Yes - the best lead possible. The Crown itself tells us where to go."
"Council03_68_Einarboss_Default","The Soraks will come after you - you know that?"
"Council03_69_Einarboss_Default","But you have our complete support in this struggle."
"Council03_70_Friendliness_Formal","Our thanks, Marshal."
"Council03_71_Friendliness_Normal","Thanks."
"Council03_72_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Don't overestimate yourselves, deputies!"
"Council03_73_Einarboss_NPC","That's right! We can't risk the Soraks overpowering them and taking the Crown!"
"Council03_74_Danantar_NPC","Well, you're welcome to provide them with whatever weapons and armors you like, Marshal."
"Council03_75_Greed_Default","We're just trying to increase our chance of success."
"Council03_76_Towerboss_NPC","Of course you are."
"Council03_77_Keenmind_NPC","We might have a few spells that can increase your chance of… survival."
"Council03_78_Danantar_NPC","Trust is a hot topic, these days."
"Council03_73_Einarboss_trust_NPC","Nobody here questions your dedication. You've done a lot already."
"Council03_71_Einarboss_NPC","Yet, we should support you in your efforts."
"Council03_72_Keenmind_NPC","And we will."
"Council03_73_Antiquariansboss_NPC","You understand, though - it is your responsibility to keep the Crown out of the wrong hands?"
"Council03_74_Selfishness_Default","The Crown chose us. I doubt it would do any good to anyone else."
"Council03_75_Keenmind_NPC","Oh, so you're experts in Manacalon sorcery now?"
"Council03_76_Einarboss_NPC","I can only concur. You have a responsibility, and it's more important than ownership."
"Council03_77_LeiraKean_NPC","If that is all, may we conclude?"
"Council03_78_Princess_NPC","I'd like to say a word, if that is appropriate."
"Council03_79_LeiraKean_NPC","Of course, Your Highness. We are listening."
"Council03_80_Princess_NPC","I think our brave deputies shouldn't be, you know, sleeping in a… city inn."
"Council03_81_Princess_NPC","We have a very comfortable residence near the Palace. "
"Council03_82_Princess_NPC","They would be safer there, don't you think?"
"Council03_83_Princess_NPC","That would be my - I mean, our - part in supporting the quest."
"Council03_84_LeiraKean_NPC","Ahem - Your Highness?"
"Council03_85_LeiraKean_NPC","I must remind you that your decisions as head of state are not subject to Council approval."
"Council03_86_Princess_NPC","Oh! Right…"
"Council03_87_LeiraKean_NPC","Might I suggest that you reiterate your offer outside these walls?"
"Council03_88_Princess_NPC","Of course. I beg the Council's pardon."
"Council03_89_LeiraKean_NPC","Not at all, Your Highness."
"Council03_90_Danantar_NPC","Then I think that is all?"
"Council03_91_LeiraKean_NPC","Thank you. The Legacy Council is now in recess."
"HostOfPrincess_1_Captain_NPC","A word, please, deputies?"
"HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Default","Sure."
"HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Formal","Of course."
"HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Slang","What's up?"
"HostOfPrincess_3_Captain_NPC","Her Royal Highness asked me to reiterate her offer to accommodate you at the Palace Residence."
"HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Default","What's that?"
"HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Formal","I'm not sure what that is."
"HostOfPrincess_5_Captain_NPC","A house for plenipotentiaries, emissaries, and other guests of the Court."
"HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Default","Sounds nice."
"HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Formal","It's an honor!"
"HostOfPrincess_7_Captain_NPC","You don't say?"
"HostOfPrincess_8_Any_Default","Where is this residence?"
"HostOfPrincess_9_Captain_NPC","In the Palace. Ask for Ravensworth, the royal butler. He'll show you."
"HostOfPrincess_10_Captain_NPC","Oh, another thing…"
"HostOfPrincess_11_Any_Default","Yes?"
"HostOfPrincess_12_Captain_NPC","I am to give this to any senior deputy of the Council."
"HostOfPrincess_13_Any_Default","What's this?"
"HostOfPrincess_14_Captain_NPC","A command word, to teleport your party to the city's Imperial Gate."
"HostOfPrincess_15__Any_Default","Teleport?"
"HostOfPrincess_16_Any_Default","We can't do that, I'm pretty sure."
"HostOfPrincess_17_Captain_NPC","Well, word is that in the Badlands…"
"HostOfPrincess_18_Captain_NPC","…you may come across functioning Major Gates."
"HostOfPrincess_19_Captain_NPC","If you do, use this command word and you'll be brought back here."
"HostOfPrincess_20_Captain_NPC","Take note of any command word on the Gate you find…"
"HostOfPrincess_21_Captain_NPC","…and you'll be able to return there the same way."
"HostOfPrincess_22_Any_Default","That's fantastic!"
"HostOfPrincess_23_Captain_NPC","Don't get too excited."
"HostOfPrincess_24_Captain_NPC","So far, no one's found any."
"HostOfPrincess_25_Any_Default","Oh. Right. Thanks anyway."
"HostOfPrincess_26_Captain_NPC","Stay in the light, senior deputies."
"HostOfPrincess_27_Any_Default","You too, Captain."
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_1_DalonLark_NPC","Clear skies, adventurers!"
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_2_EinarWorshipper_Default","Fire to your blade!"
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_3_DalonLark_NPC","One of the faithful, I see. Nice to meet you!"
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_4_DalonLark_NPC","I am Chaplain Dalon Lark."
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_5_DalonLark_NPC","You may come here at any time to seek the help of the Church."
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_6_AnyBeliever_Einar","That is good to know, Chaplain!"
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_7_NonBeliever_Default","Hello!"
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_8_AnyBeliever_Default","What do you do here?"
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_9_DalonLark_NPC","I represent the Church of Einar, the god of valor and fidelity."
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_10_DalonLark_NPC","We provide various services for those who need them."
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_11_Cynical_Default","And can pay for them?"
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_12_DalonLark_NPC","Those who seek his healing are rarely poor."
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_13_Any_Default","We do require your services."
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default","Thank you - we need to go."
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_15_DalonLark_NPC","Stay in the light, adventurers!"
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ExitLine","We should go."
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ShopLine","We need your services."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_02_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Clear skies, adventurers!"
"Arcaneum_Dialog_02_2_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Anything new for the Arcaneum?"
"Arcaneum_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang","Check this out!"
"Arcaneum_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default","Possibly."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang","Just passing by."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_02_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","That's nice of you."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_02_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Stay in the light!"
"Arcaneum_Dialog_Exitline","Just passing by."
"Arcaneum_Dialog_Offer","Let's talk business!"
"Danantar_Dialog_02_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Deputies."
"Danantar_Dialog_02_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Do you have anything for the Circle?"
"Danantar_Dialog_02_3_Any_Default","Take a look."
"Danantar_Dialog_02_4_Any_Formal","We might."
"Danantar_Dialog_02_5_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Not really. Just stopped by to say hello."
"Danantar_Dialog_02_6_Any_Default","It's an honor. "
"Danantar_Dialog_02_7_JorielFoxeye_NPC","Stay in the light, deputies!"
"Danantar_Dialog_Exitline","Just saying hello."
"Danantar_Dialog_Offer","What about this?"
"Antiquarians_Dialog_02_1_HalmanSummer_NPC","Clear skies, my friends!"
"Antiquarians_Dialog_02_2_HalmanSummer_NPC","You have some treasure in your backpacks?"
"Antiquarians_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang","Feast your eyes on this!"
"Antiquarians_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default","See what you think of this."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_02_5_HalmanSummer_NPC","Just passing by to say hello."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_02_6_HalmanSummer_NPC","Ah, well. It was good to see you."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_02_7_HalmanSummer_NPC","See you next time, friends!"
"Antiquarians_Dialog_ExitLine","Just passing by."
"Antiquarians_Dialog_Offer","What about this?"
"Tower_Dialog_02_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","Deputies! How are you today?"
"Tower_Dialog_02_2_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","Do you have some lovely loot from the Badlands?"
"Tower_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang","How 'bout that?"
"Tower_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default","Indeed."
"Tower_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang","Just missed your smiling face, Miss Greenisle!"
"Tower_Dialog_02_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","Such nice manners! All too rare, these days."
"Tower_Dialog_02_7_MaddyGreenisle_NPC","Clear skies to you!"
"Tower_Dialog_Exitline","Just missed you."
"Tower_Dialog_Offer","How about that?"
"Council4_1_LeiraKean_NPC","Honorable delegates, please be seated!"
"Council4_2_LeiraKean_NPC","The Legacy Council is now in session!"
"Council4_3_Danantar_NPC","Ah - senior deputies! What news is there?"
"Council4_4_Authority_Normal","We're stuck, my lord."
"Council4_5_Authority_Formal","My lord, I'm afraid the situation is less than ideal."
"Council4_6_Authority_Slang","It's not good news, my Lord."
"Council4_7_Faisech_NPC","Meaning what, exactly?"
"Council4_10_Faisech_NPC","Perhaps they've been destroyed."
"Council4_11_Keenmind_NPC","We tested the first one - it can't be done!"
"Council4_12_Danantar_NPC","They must be magically concealed."
"Council4_13_Sunblaze_NPC","So the Crown must remain incomplete?"
"Council4_14_Gormsdottir_NPC","Maybe the Soraks have the missing gems."
"Council4_15_Gormsdottir_NPC","After all, they attacked you more than once. They're clearly still after the Crown."
"Council4_16_Faisech_NPC","If you can't find the gems, why keep the Crown out there?"
"Council4_17_Faisech_NPC","It will keep attracting the Soraks."
"Council4_18_Danantar_NPC","The attunement, remember?"
"Council4_19_Faisech_NPC","I'm sorry, senior deputies, but despite the attunement…"
"Council4_20_Faisech_NPC","…I believe the Crown should be secured…"
"Council4_21_Faisech_NPC","…and secured by more than four adventurers who spend their nights camped in the Badlands!"
"Council4_22_Sunblaze_NPC","We can't do that to them! They have served the Council faithfully!"
"Council4_23_Faisech_NPC","Don't be naive! We are facing a major threat!"
"Council4_24_Faisech_NPC","You understand the meaning of sacrifice, and so should they!"
"Council4_25_Authority_Normal","We have searched the Badlands for these gems, at our own risk."
"Council4_26_Crownbearer_Normal","We trusted you to keep your word and leave us the Crown."
"Council4_27_Danantar_NPC","If I may, I think we need more time to consider the situation."
"Council4_28_Faisech_NPC","More time? How much time?"
"Council4_29_Danantar_NPC","Maybe just… give it a night."
"Council4_30_Gormsdottir_NPC","I could use the day to consult with my people."
"Council4_31_Keenmind_NPC","So could I."
"Council4_32_Danantar_NPC","Fine, then! Anyone against?"
"Council4_33_LeiraKean_NPC","Thank you, Lord Danantar."
"Council4_34_LeiraKean_NPC","The Legacy Council is now adjourned!"
"Council4_35_Selfpres_Normal","I have a bad feeling about this."
"Council4_36_Crownbearer_Normal","I knew it! They'll take the Crown, and never mind what that does to me!"
"Council4_37_Crownbearer_Slang","Typical! Sat there on their pretty chairs… doesn't matter if I die!"
"Council4_38_Authority_Normal","This is wrong."
"Council4_39_Selfpres_Normal","We could run."
"Council4_40_Authority_Normal","What's the point? We know what's at stake."
"Council4_41_Crownbearer_Normal","They're right about one thing."
"Council4_42_Crownbearer_Normal","The Soraks will keep coming after us. After the Crown."
"Council4_43_Authority_Normal","We could retrace our steps - go back to where we found the gems. Perhaps there's a trail we overlooked."
"Council4_44_Crownbearer_Normal","There's nothing anymore - I can't feel another gem anywhere!"
"Council4_45_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Excuse me, senior deputies."
"Council4_46_Highclass_Formal","Master Surespell."
"Council4_47_Any_Normal","Clear skies, Heddlon."
"Council4_48_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I would advise you to avoid the Palace Residence tonight."
"Council4_49_Crownbearer_Normal","What? Why?"
"Council4_50_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I'm not at liberty to say… just trust me."
"Council4_51_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","You have your lodgings at the Gravekeep's Cask. You should spend the night there."
"Council4_52_Selfpres_Normal","What kind of advice is that?"
"Council4_53_Selfpres_Formal","You must realize your suggestion is… unusual. Suspicious, even."
"Council4_54_Selfpres_Slang","Are you crazy? Or are you up to something?"
"Council4_55_Nosy_Normal","Are you really working for the Arcaneum? "
"Council4_56_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Why else would I be here?"
"Council4_57_Mean_Normal","This elf is…"
"Council4_58_Lawful_Normal","What do you think?"
"Council4_59_Pragmatic_Normal","It sounds like a warning."
"Council4_60_Selfpres_Normal","Or a threat!"
"Council4_61_Lawful_Normal","Can we trust him?"
"Council4_62_Carver_Normal","Trust the New Empire?"
"Council4_63_Greed_Normal","I have no idea what to do, but I'd like to sleep in a bed tonight."
"Council4_64_Cynical_Normal","I miss Karel's beer."
"Council4_65_Any4_Normal","And Merton's sweet talk."
"Council4_66_Cynical_Normal","I'd prefer the residence."
"Council4_67_Cynical_Normal","I like Captain Ironshell kissing me goodnight."
"Council4_68_Authority_Normal","Maybe in your dreams."
"NightAttack_1_Selfpres_Default","Soraks - here?"
"NightAttack_2_Selfpres_Slang","Soraks! Right here in our damn room!"
"NightAttack_3_Selfpres_Formal","The Sorr-Akkath in the palace residence!"
"NightAttack_4_Pragmatic_Default","We were warned."
"NightAttack_5_Nosy_Default","Surespell? How did he know?"
"NightAttack_6_Nosy_Default","Why would he know what the Soraks would do?"
"NightAttack_7_Pragmatic_Default","He tried to warn us. Not what an enemy would do."
"NightAttack_8_Pragmatic_Slang","He tried to save our hides, remember?"
"NightAttack_9_Pragmatic_Formal","His warning might have saved us all, mind you."
"NightAttack_10_Selfpres_Normal","He just wants us to think he's a friend."
"NightAttack_11_Selfpres_Formal","It might be an elaborate scheme to gain our trust."
"NightAttack_12_Pragmatic_Default","Too far-fetched."
"NightAttack_13_Friendly_Default","So what do we do?"
"NightAttack_14_Friendly_Slang","What's the plan, then?"
"NightAttack_15_Friendly_Formal","Be that as it may, what shall we do now?"
"NightAttack_16_Pragmatic_Normal","Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided."
"NightAttack_17_Pragmatic_Formal","We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say."
"NightAttack_18_Nosy_Default","Or we could pay Surespell a visit."
"NightAttack2_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Ah, here you are."
"NightAttack2_2_Any_Normal","Are you surprised?"
"NightAttack2_3_Any_Formal","Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?"
"NightAttack2_4_Any_Slang","That's right. Surprised?"
"NightAttack2_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Not really. I did warn you, after all. I'm glad you were careful."
"NightAttack2_6_Any_Default","How did you know?"
"NightAttack2_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Call it a hunch. "
"NightAttack2_8_Any_Slang","A great, steaming pile of hunch. Got a bridge to sell, too?"
"NightAttack2_9_Any_Normal","Oh, really?"
"NightAttack2_10_Any_Formal","You can't expect us to believe that?"
"NightAttack2_11_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Oh, I have friends who… gather information."
"NightAttack2_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","The threat felt credible. I thought it wise to share."
"NightAttack2_13_Cynical_Normal","It felt real enough to us, too."
"NightAttack2_14_Cynical_Formal","Real enough to leave a scar, that much is certain."
"NightAttack2_15_Selfpres_Default","You know more than you're telling."
"NightAttack2_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Always. But I'm on your side, and that's all that matters."
"NightAttack2_17_Cynical_Normal","Really? Aren't we lucky? So what other pearls of wisdom do you have to share - friend?"
"NightAttack2_18_Cynical_Formal","In that case, you'd be happy to advise us further, I presume?"
"NightAttack2_19_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Certainly. Always drink wine at the Gravekeep's Cask. Their beer is utterly foul."
"NightAttack2_20_Pragmatic_Normal","Seriously? Everyone knows that!"
"NightAttack2_21_Pragmatic_Formal","That's disappointing. You can do better than common knowledge, I'm sure. "
"NightAttack2_21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","But clearly you're here for business, not small talk."
"NightAttack4_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Ah, here you are."
"NightAttack4_2_Any_Normal","Are you surprised?"
"NightAttack4_3_Any_Formal","Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?"
"NightAttack4_4_Any_Slang","That's right. Surprised?"
"NightAttack4_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Not at all, since you followed my… advice."
"NightAttack4_4_Any_Default","How do you know that?"
"NightAttack4_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","You're here, alive and unwounded."
"NightAttack4_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I heard there was some disturbance at the residence."
"NightAttack4_7_Any_Default","Is that so?"
"NightAttack3_1_CaptainIronshell_NPC","Senior deputies!"
"NightAttack3_2_Friendly_Default","Captain! What's the news?"
"NightAttack3_3_CaptainIronshell_NPC","You didn't hear?"
"NightAttack3_4_CaptainIronshell_NPC","Your quarters at the residence were ransacked!"
"NightAttack3_5_Nosy_Default","What? When?"
"NightAttack3_6_CaptainIronshell_NPC","During the night. It's lucky you weren't there."
"NightAttack3_7_Cynical_Formal","Eh. We could have handled a burglar or two."
"NightAttack3_8_Cynical_Normal","No doubt we would have seen the villains off, had we been there."
"NightAttack3_9_CaptainIronshell_NPC","They were more than simple burglars, to infiltrate the palace undetected."
"NightAttack3_10_Nosy_Default","Who, then?"
"NightAttack3_11_CaptainIronshell_NPC","I can't say for sure but…"
"NightAttack3_12_CaptainIronshell_NPC","Some are saying… Sorr-Akkath."
"NightAttack3_13_Selfpres_Formal","That's a worrying prospect, Captain."
"NightAttack3_14_Selfpres_Slang","So much for palace security, then. Thanks a lot!"
"NightAttack3_15_Selfpres_Normal","We were supposed to be safe there, remember?"
"NightAttack3_16_CaptainIronshell_NPC","I'm well aware. We have put further magical security measures in place."
"NightAttack3_17_Friendly_Default","Good to know."
"NightAttack3_18_Friendly_Normal","Thanks for the heads-up, Captain."
"NightAttack3_19_Friendly_Formal","Thank you for keeping us informed, Captain."
"NightAttack3_20_CaptainIronshell_NPC","You are most welcome."
"NightAttack3_21_CaptainIronshell_NPC","Good day to you, senior deputies."
"NightAttack3_22_Nosy_Normal","So he told the truth, that Heddlon."
"NightAttack3_23_Nosy_Formal","It appears Heddlon Surespell was right."
"NightAttack3_24_Pragmatic_Default","He knew, but how?"
"NightAttack3_25_Selfpres_Normal","He's a spy, or something similar."
"NightAttack3_26_Selfpres_Formal","I'm pretty sure he's Imperial Intelligence."
"NightAttack3_27_Selfpres_Slang","The guy is a spook, it's practically written on his face."
"NightAttack3_28_Pragmatic_Default","He looks normal to me."
"NightAttack3_29_Logical_Default","That's what spies do. "
"NightAttack3_30_Friendly_Default","So, what do we do?"
"NightAttack3_31_Friendly_Slang","So - now what?"
"NightAttack3_32_Friendly_Formal","We must decide on our next move."
"NightAttack3_33_Pragmatic_Normal","Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided."
"NightAttack3_34_Pragmatic_Formal","We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say."
"NightAttack3_35_Nosy_Default","Or we could pay Surespell a visit."
"Council5_1_LeiraKean_NPC","Honorable delegates, please be seated!"
"Council5_2_LeiraKean_NPC","The Legacy Council is now in session!"
"Council5_3_LeiraKean_NPC","Chancellor Gormsdottir has the floor."
"Council5_4_Gormsdottir_NPC","Thank you, Protector."
"Council5_5_Gormsdottir_NPC","Honorable Council members, we at the Guild of Antiquarians have come to an agreement…"
"Council5_6_Gormsdottir_NPC","…regarding the quest for the gems of the Crown of the Magister."
"Council5_7_Gormsdottir_NPC","We believe that the Crown should be secured, and therefore surrendered by its current owners…"
"Council5_8_Gormsdottir_NPC","…in exchange for a generous payment…"
"Council5_9_Gormsdottir_NPC","…raised by all parties in the Council."
"Council5_10_Crownbearer_Default","You can't!"
"Council5_11_LeiraKean_NPC","You will wait for your turn to speak, senior deputy!"
"Council5_12_Crownbearer_Default","We searched the Badlands for these gems, and now you're just taking the Crown away from us?"
"Council5_13_LeiraKean_NPC","Order!"
"Council5_14_Danantar_NPC","We are all well aware of your reservations, and we understand them."
"Council5_15_Danantar_NPC","Yet, from what I heard, all parties have agreed that you should comply…"
"Council5_16_Danantar_NPC","…for the security of all."
"Council5_17_Crownbearer_Default","Security? You talk of security?"
"Council5_18_Crownbearer_Default","What security? Just last night, Soraks attacked our quarters in the residence!"
"Council5_19_Faisech_NPC","What?"
"Council5_20_Sunblaze_NPC","Soraks? Here in Caer Cyflen?"
"Council5_21_Danantar_NPC","In the palace?"
"Council5_22_LeiraKean_NPC","Order!"
"Council5_23_Sunblaze_NPC","Immediate action is needed!"
"Council5_24_Danantar_NPC","Well, find the damned Soraks, then!"
"Council5_25_LeiraKean_NPC","Please, my lords!"
"Council5_26_Danantar_NPC","Where are your paladins?"
"Council5_27_Sunblaze_NPC","Where are your wizards and their divination spells?"
"Council5_28_LeiraKean_NPC","Stop it!"
"Council5_29_LeiraKean_NPC","None of this is helping!"
"Council5_30_LeiraKean_NPC","Lord Sunblaze, you're supposed to be neutral here!"
"Council5_31_LeiraKean_NPC","Someone must introduce a formal request."
"Council5_32_Danantar_NPC","Right. Apologies."
"Council5_33_Danantar_NPC","You're right, let's vote. Only senior members, please."
"Council5_34_Danantar_NPC","Those for securing the Crown, say aye."
"Council5_35_Gormsdottir_Default","Aye."
"Council5_36_Faisech_NPC","Aye."
"Council5_37_Danantar_NPC","Aye."
"Council5_38_Keenmind_Default","…nay."
"Council5_39_Sunblaze_NPC","Nay."
"Council5_40_Danantar_NPC","Well, we have a majority."
"Council5_41_Sunblaze_NPC","We'll help you with the… attunement issue."
"Council5_42_Faisech_NPC","Wait! Who's going to take the Crown, and where?"
"Council5_43_Danantar_NPC","Well, the most secure location would be…"
"Council5_44_Danantar_NPC","…the temple of Einar, of course. The Hearth."
"Council5_45_Faisech_NPC","Of course - right here in Caer Cyflen!"
"Council5_46_Faisech_NPC","Neutral ground, of course, but still the Principality of Masgarth is the center of Solasta!"
"Council5_47_Danantar_NPC","Do you have a better idea, Dean Faisech?"
"Council5_48_Faisech_NPC","We have secure locations, too!"
"Council5_49_Danantar_NPC","How many high-ranking paladins in your Tower, Faisech?"
"Council5_50_Faisech_NPC","More than actual wizards in your school!"
"Council5_51_LeiraKean_NPC","Order!"
"Council5_52_LeiraKean_NPC","Remember the dignity of your positions, my lords!"
"Council5_53_LeiraKean_NPC","Senior deputies - if you please? The Council has spoken."
"Council5_54_Choice_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","This is a mistake."
"Council5_55_Choice_Mean_WRITTEN","You're all stupid!"
"Council5_56_Choice_Lawful_WRITTEN","We must obey the Council…"
"Council5_57_Choice_Selfpres_WRITTEN","Someone here is a traitor!"
"Council5_58_Choice_Pragmatic_Default","This is a mistake. We are bound to the Crown."
"Council5_59_LeiraKean_NPC","You are sworn deputies. You must comply."
"Council5_60_Choice_Mean_Default","The Council doesn't deserve the Crown - you just proved that!"
"Council5_61_LeiraKean_NPC","Surrender the Crown, as the Council orders."
"Council5_62_Choice_Lawful_Default","We serve the Council."
"Council5_63_LeiraKean_NPC","And you shall be commended, senior deputies."
"Council5_64_Choice_Selfpres_Default","You keep bickering instead of looking for the traitor among you!"
"Council5_65_LeiraKean_NPC","This is a grave accusation, senior deputy."
"Council5_66_Authority_Default","How could they?"
"Council5_67_Pragmatic_Default","It can't end like this!"
"Council5_68_Crownbearer_Default","I can hear it calling!"
"Council5_69_HalmanSummer_NPC","Senior deputies, please, a word?"
"Council5_70_Authority_Default","Summer? What do you want? "
"Council5_71_Authority_Default","Your chancellor led the charge against us in there."
"Council5_72_HalmanSummer_NPC","I'm truly sorry. But, I have some information that might interest you."
"Council5_73_Selfpres_Default","I doubt it."
"Council5_74_HalmanSummer_NPC","It's about the secret cult of Arivad."
"Council5_75_Nosy_Default","What?"
"Council5_76_HalmanSummer_NPC","I admit, this is second-hand intelligence, but still…"
"Council5_77_Authority_Default","Speak up."
"Council5_78_HalmanSummer_NPC","One of my people saw a man with a tattoo…"
"Council5_79_Selfpres_Default","The letter A?"
"Council5_80_HalmanSummer_NPC","Yes. He followed the man all day, and to a gathering that night…"
"Council5_81_HalmanSummer_NPC","…in a remote village to the south."
"Council5_82_Authority_Default","What village?"
"Council5_83_HalmanSummer_NPC","It's called Earcorn. Very small…"
"Council5_84_HalmanSummer_NPC","…but you'll find it easily on any local map."
"Council5_85_Friendly_Default","Thank you, Halman."
"Council5_86_HalmanSummer_NPC","You're welcome. Someone must take care of these cultists."
"Council5_87_HalmanSummer_NPC","And the Council… well, you know."
"Council5_88_Pragmatic_Default","Yes, we do."
"Council5_After_1_BericSunblaze_NPC","I'm so sorry."
"Council5_After_2_Friendly_Default","Why? You didn't betray us."
"Council5_After_3_BericSunblaze_NPC","I understand how they see things, but…"
"Council5_After_4_Selfpres_Normal","Something's wrong with the Council."
"Council5_After_5_Selfpres_Slang","The Council's rotten."
"Council5_After_6_BericSunblaze_NPC","The Council's still young. Everyone is angling for influence…"
"Council5_After_7_BericSunblaze_NPC","…but squabbling academics are better than clashing armies."
"Council5_After_8_Nosy_Default","Only Airgetine supported us? I mean, beside you."
"Council5_After_9_Selfpres_Default","Why would the New Empire be the only friend we have in there?"
"Council5_After_10_BericSunblaze_NPC","Airgetine's a moderate, it's true, but the New Empire is subtle. Plans within plans."
"Council5_After_11_BericSunblaze_NPC","It's hard to say whether he was following orders or voting his conscience."
"Council5_After_12_BericSunblaze_NPC","I wouldn't read too much into his vote, at least for now. "
"Council5_After_13_BericSunblaze_NPC","It didn't change anything, anyway."
"Council5_After_14_BericSunblaze_NPC","But what about you? How are you coping without the Crown?"
"Council5_After_15_Crownbearer_Default","Better than I expected."
"Council5_After_16_Any2_Default","Same for me, actually. It almost feels like we still have the Crown."
"Council5_After_17_Any3_Default","Exactly. We lost its magical power, but…"
"Council5_After_18_Any2_Default","…the voice is still calling."
"Council5_After_19_BericSunblaze_NPC","Interesting. So the attunement is unaffected by physical separation?"
"Council5_After_20_Friendly_Any","Keep the Crown safe, Marshal, will you, please?"
"Council5_After_21_BericSunblaze_NPC","You have my word."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_1_Merton_NPC","Hey, you!"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_2_Cynical_Default","Not drowning in your beer today, Arwin?"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_3_Merton_NPC","No, wait!"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_4_Merton_NPC","They took the Crown from you?"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_5_Selfpres_Default","How do you know that?"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_6_Merton_NPC","How? You really think I'm just a drunk?"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_7_Merton_NPC","The whole Principality knows you have that Crown."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_8_Merton_NPC","I mean had."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_9_Cynical_Normal","Yeah."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_10_Cynical_Formal","Indeed."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_11_Merton_NPC","Something's not right."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_12_Cynical_Normal","You think we need you to tell us?"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_13_Merton_NPC","I mean something's up - something big."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_14_Pragmatic_Normal","What, exactly?"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_15_Merton_NPC","They're here."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_16_Selfpres_Default","Who? The Soraks?"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_17_Merton_NPC","Not them. Their pawns."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_18_Lawful_Default","You're drunk."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_19_Merton_NPC","What's wrong with you? "
"MertonAfterCouncil5_20_Merton_NPC","Haven't you seen enough?"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_21_Merton_NPC","Didn't you see what they can do? "
"MertonAfterCouncil5_22_Merton_NPC","To people?"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_23_Merton_NPC","At first I thought you were just another bunch of brainless Council lackeys…"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_24_Merton_NPC","…but you've seen their ways."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_25_Merton_NPC","At Coparann, and plenty other places, I'm sure."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_26_Merton_NPC","The way they get into people's heads."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_27_Merton_NPC","I've watched the people of Caer Cyflen for ten years."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_28_Merton_NPC","I've felt a change - slow, subtle…"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_29_Merton_NPC","…until now. It's getting stronger!"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_30_Merton_NPC","I can't let them win."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_31_Cynical_Default","So what? You're ready to become a hero again?"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_32_Merton_NPC","I can still fight."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_33_Pragmatic_Default","Are you offering to join us?"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_34_Merton_NPC","You brought back my sword."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_35_Merton_NPC","That blade and I, we've slain countless abominations down there in the Badlands."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_36_Merton_NPC","You helped me get closure for my lost child."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_37_Merton_NPC","You were at my side when we took down the remorhaz."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_38_Merton_NPC","Yes, I'd like to join you."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_39_Choice_WRITTEN","Fine."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_40_Choice_WRITTEN","No."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_41_Agreed_Default","Fine, come with us."
"MertonAfterCouncil5_42_Refused_Default","You're useless!"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_43_Refused_Merton","And you're stupid!"
"MertonAfterCouncil5_44_Agreed_Merton","Ha ha! Now you're talking!"
"FightingCultists_1_1_Authority_Default","This is it? Earcorn!"
"FightingCultists_1_2_Merton_NPC","Look, a farm! And another! High adventure - I love it!"
"FightingCultists_1_3_Cynical_Normal","This doesn't exactly feel like the headquarters for a massive invasion."
"FightingCultists_1_4_Cynical_Slang","Some headquarters. Dark cults used to be better."
"FightingCultists_1_5_Cynical_Formal","Not exactly how I imagined the lair of evil Sorr-Akkath worshippers."
"FightingCultists_1_6_Pragmatic_Default","But it could be hiding a small group of infiltrators."
"FightingCultists_1_7_Pragmatic_Default","Still, a good cover for cunning infiltrators."
"FightingCultists_1_8_Pragmatic_Normal","Let's look around for anything suspicious."
"FightingCultists_1_9_Pragmatic_Formal","Let us examine the area in search of clues."
"FightingCultists_1_10_Cynical_Default","No tavern? That's suspicious for a start."
"FightingCultists_1_11_Merton_NPC","That was my line!"
"FightingCultists_1_12_Authority_Slang","Shut up! We're trying to be stealthy!"
"FightingCultists_1_13_Authority_Normal","You'd better be quiet if you don't want us to be spotted."
"FightingCultists_1_14_Authority_Format","Quiet, if you please. Let discretion be our watchword."
"FightingCultists_2_1_Any_Default","I have something!"
"FightingCultists_2_2_Cynical_Default","Footprints? Really? It's a village. People live here."
"FightingCultists_2_3_Cynical_Default","Random footprints in a village? Not much of a clue."
"FightingCultists_2_4_Merton_NPC","Your villagers have claws."
"FightingCultists_2_5_Any_Default","Your villagers have claws."
"FightingCultists_2_6_Selfpres_Default","Soraks?"
"FightingCultists_2_7_Authority_Default","This is it! Be ready for anything."
"AfterFightingCultists_1_Pragmatic_Default","That didn't feel like we surprised them."
"AfterFightingCultists_2_Violent_Default","Because we didn't."
"AfterFightingCultists_3_Selfpres_Default","This was a trap."
"AfterFightingCultists_4_Merton_NPC","Yep, carefully set up to kill us - well, you, I guess."
"AfterFightingCultists_5_Selfpres_Default","Halman Summer?"
"AfterFightingCultists_6_Pragmatic_Default","He said the intelligence wasn't certain."
"AfterFightingCultists_7_Merton_NPC","The Antiquarian? He told you about this place?"
"AfterFightingCultists_8_Violent_Default","He's a traitor!"
"AfterFightingCultists_9_Nosy_Default","A Sorak in disguise?"
"AfterFightingCultists_10_Pragmatic_Default","Or just one of their agents."
"AfterFightingCultists_11_Merton_NPC","Or just one of their agents."
"AfterFightingCultists_12_Pragmatic_Default","Anyone checked him for a tattoo?"
"AfterFightingCultists_13_Violent_Default","There's only one way to know for sure."
"AfterFightingCultists_14_Authority_Default","Let's go back to Caer Cyflen."
"ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Normal","What's going on?"
"ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Formal","What is all this?"
"ReturnToCC_2_Pragmatic_Default","Is that the army? In the city?"
"ReturnToCC_3_Violent_Default","Let's find Summer!"
"ReturnToCC_4_Pragmatic_Default","I'd prefer to find Carran first."
"ReturnToCC_5_Merton_NPC","I have to check on someone. I'll catch you later."
"ReturnToCC_6_Nosy_Default","Check on who?"
"ReturnToCC_7_Nosy_Default","I thought he had no friends left."
"ReturnToCC_8_Cynical_Default","His brewer, maybe?"
"ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Normal","Hello, Karel! Have you seen Lord Carran?"
"ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Slang","Hey, Karel! Seen Carran around?"
"ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Formal","Greetings, master Martel. Have you seen lord Carran recently?"
"ReturnToCC_Bartender_2_KarelMartel_NPC","Not since the conscription."
"ReturnToCC_Bartender_3_Any_Default","Conscription? Is that what's happening?"
"ReturnToCC_Bartender_4_KarelMartel_NPC","I know, it's been in the air, but now…"
"ReturnToCC_Bartender_5_KarelMartel_NPC","…rumors has it that Gallivan's armies are massing at the eastern border."
"ReturnToCC_Bartender_6_Any_Default","Gallivan? Why?"
"ReturnToCC_Bartender_7_KarelMartel_NPC","Ask your friends on the Council. They were supposed to keep the peace."
"ReturnToCC_Robar1_Any_Default","Robar? You've been drafted?"
"ReturnToCC_Robar2_Robar_NPC","Don't be ridiculous - I enlisted! Gets me the rank I deserve. Finally."
"ReturnToCC_Robar3_Any_Default","Captain? That's even higher than Beryl Stonebeard."
"ReturnToCC_Robar4_Robar_NPC","I'd rather forget that time, fighting Soraks in that hellhole Caer Lem."
"ReturnToCC_Robar5_Any_NPC","Is war really better?"
"ReturnToCC_Robar6_Sellsword_Default","Can't disagree."
"ReturnToCC_Robar7_Robar_NPC","Gallivan's armies are honest foes - flesh, blood, and steel."
"ReturnToCC_Robar8_Any_NPC","If you say so."
"ReturnToCC_Robar9_Any_NPC","Be safe, Robar."
"ReturnToCC_Robar10_Sellsword_Default","To the bitter end, brother."
"ReturnToCC_Robar11_Robar_Default","To the bitter end."
"ReturnToCC_Robar12_Robar_Default","You, too."
"ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Any_NPC","Beryl? What's going on?"
"ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Highclass_Default","Lady Stonebeard, what is happening?"
"ReturnToCC_Beryl2_Beryl_NPC","You still here? I suppose we owe this mess to you?"
"ReturnToCC_Beryl3_Any_Default","What mess?"
"ReturnToCC_Beryl4_Beryl_NPC","War. Or the threat of war."
"ReturnToCC_Beryl5_Any_Default","We didn't do anything!"
"ReturnToCC_Beryl6_Beryl_NPC","Well, the Snow Alliance representatives are leaving."
"ReturnToCC_Beryl7_Beryl_NPC","We don't want to be caught between Masgarth and Gallivan."
"ReturnToCC_Beryl8_Any_Default","How about maintaining peace?"
"ReturnToCC_Beryl9_Beryl_NPC","I did my part. Didn't work."
"ReturnToCC_Beryl10_Any_Default","When are you leaving?"
"ReturnToCC_Beryl11_Beryl_NPC","As soon as my dawdling cousin gives the order."
"ReturnToCC_Beryl12_Beryl_NPC","Let's hope we can meet again, on the same side."
"ReturnToCC_Beryl13_Any_NPC","Farewell, Beryl."
"ReturnToCC_Beryl14_Highclass_Default","Good luck, my lady."
"ReturnToCC_Beryl15_Beryl_NPC","Cut the 'my' lady stuff, will you?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat1_Any_Default","Daliat! What's going on?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat2_Daliat_NPC","Well, I'd rather not say."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat3_Any_Default","Always secretive."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat4_Spy_Default","Do we still need to play this game?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Oh, hello."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat6_Any_Default","Heddlon Surespell, what a surprise."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat7_Spy_Default","Are you two related?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat8_Daliat_NPC","He's my superior."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Two ranks above."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat10_Daliat_Default","Right."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat11_Spy_NPC","So, you two are spies?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat12_HeddlonSurespell_Default","Such a crude word."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat13_Daliat_NPC","We prefer the old name: 'Silent Whisper.'"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat14_Lawful_Default","The intelligence service of the Manacalon Empire? Really?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat15_Daliat_NPC","Nicer than 'spies.'"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat16_Authority_Default","So, what's in there?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat17_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Nothing and no one, I'm afraid."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat18_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I was looking for your… acquaintance, Halman Summer."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat19_Violent_Default","Oh, him?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat20_Violent_Default","We were looking for him, too."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I'm afraid he's gone."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat22_Pragmatic_Default","Isn't everybody leaving?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat23_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","The Antiquarians and the other Snow Alliance people are pulling out."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat24_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","The Antiquarians are still packing up, though."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat25_Pragmatic_Default","He sent after a lead…"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat26_Selfpres_Default","…or rather, into a trap."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat27_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","I'm not surprised."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat28_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","We had eyes on him, but… we lost him."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat29_Selfpres_Default","Is he that good?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat30_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Or he had help. Magical."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat31_Selfpres_NPC","Soraks?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat32_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","Who knows?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat33_Pragmatic_NPC","What triggered all this?"
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat34_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","You should really get to the Council."
"ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat35_HeddlonSurespell_NPC","They'll tell you everything."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_1_Carran_NPC","In Maraike's name! You're here!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_Any_Default","What is happening?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_3_Carran_NPC","The whole delegation from the Tower of Knowledge - they were poisoned!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_4_Nosy_Default","Poisoned? How many died?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_5_Carran_NPC","All of them, thirty-something, but that's not the point."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_6_Carran_NPC","After Dean Faisech accused the Council of… favoritism toward the Principality…"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_7_Carran_NPC","…for keeping the Crown in Caer Cyflen."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_8_Pragmatic_Default","At the Temple of Einar, which is not affiliated with the Principality."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_9_Carran_NPC","I know that, of course."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_10_Carran_NPC","Yet, soon after, we all ate at the same table, but the Tower delegates died in their sleep."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_11_Carran_NPC","Of course, Gallivan took it as an attack by the Principality."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_12_Pragmatic_Default","But that's why the Tower's on the Council, and not Gallivan's government - to avoid exactly that!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_13_Carran_NPC","You think I don't know that?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_14_Carran_NPC","This is real politics, my friends - diplomacy is dead."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_15_Cynical_Default","So the Legacy Council was a sham all along?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_16_Carran_NPC","No! It was a real, honest effort to maintain peace."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_17_Cynical_Default","And it failed."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_18_Carran_NPC","We're not at war yet."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_19_Pragmatic_Default","But Gallivan's massing troops at the border."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_20_Carran_NPC","Bad news really does travel fast."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_21_Carran_NPC","Anyway, pressure is growing for the Princess to… intervene."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_22_Cynical_Default","Her? How?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_23_Carran_NPC","Not as a member of the Council. As head of state."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_24_Carran_NPC","But tell me, where were you now that your quest is… well…"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_25_Authority_Default","Chasing the Soraks and their pawns."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_26_Cynical_Default","Unsuccessfully."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_27_Violent_Default","Halman Summer might have been one of them."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_28_Carran_NPC","What? The man was… I mean, I dined at his mansion recently… he…"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_29_Nosy_Default","Where?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_30_Carran_NPC","Where what?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_31_Authority_Default","A mansion? He told us he lived at the Snow Alliance embassy."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_32_Carran_NPC","No - his family has a mansion in town."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_33_Carran_NPC","Oddly, it's right next door to the Circle of Danantar's headquarters."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_34_Authority_Default","We need to go there."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_35_Carran_NPC","I might need you when you're done with this errand."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad1_Authority_Normal","Is that it?"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad2_Authority_Formal","Is this the place?"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad3_Nosy_Normal","I don't see a sign, or a coat of arms, or anything."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad4_Nosy_Formal","Nothing to say this is Halman Summer's residence."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad5_Spy_Normal","Not bad for a secret home."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad6_Spy_Slang","He's no dummy."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad7_Pragmatic_Formal","And close to official buildings - who would suspect anything?"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad8_Pragmatic_Normal","Hiding in plain sight - classic."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad9_Spy_Default","Let's go around. Maybe find a window and get inside."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad10_Lawful_Default","We should obtain a warrant."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad11_Pragmatic_Default","We're past that, don't you think?"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad12_Violent_Default","Since I intend to kill him, I believe we are."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad13_Spy_Default","Come on - they're all preparing for war, no one's paying attention."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside1_Any_Normal","This place is… insane."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside2_Any_Formal","Truly, a den of madness."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside3_Religion_Maraike_Default","Holy Maraike…"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside4_Religion_Einar_Default","Einar protect us all…"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside5_Religion_Arun_Default","In the name of Arun, this place is unthinkable!"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside6_Religion_Pakri_Default","Pakri be with us, we have found our enemy!"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside7_Lawful_Default","In the middle of Caer Cyflen! How could they…?"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside8_Pragmatic_Default","Dissimulation is their creed."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside9_Violent_Default","This ends now. Let's kill them all!"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside10_Pragmatic_Default","Maybe they have the gems."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded1_Friendly_Normal","Hey - I've seen this man at the Gravekeep's Cask!"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded_Friendly_Formal","I know that face! He was at the Gravekeep's Cask."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded2_Pragmatic_Normal","They're all from town!"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded3_EinarAuthority_Normal","Corrupted by the Soraks!"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded4_Selfpres_Normal","For years, maybe. They were preparing."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded5_Greed_Normal","There's a ton of paperwork here."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded6_Pragmatic_Normal","A lot's been burned, though."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded7_Greed_Normal","No sign of the gems."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded8_Pragmatic_Normal","Look at this - a map of the Badlands."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded9_Nosy_Normal","What are these places?"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded10_Pragmatic_Normal","Everywhere we've been… and some other places."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded11_Greed_Normal","The gems… all eight of them."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded12_Nosy_Normal","And this?"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded13_History_Normal","Probably the location of the Rift."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded14_History_Normal","It's in the Aer Elai, the heart of Manacalon. Where the capital was."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded15_Nosy_Normal","And this?"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded16_Pragmatic_Normal","No idea."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded17_Carver_Normal","Not a dwarf rune."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded18_Greed_Normal","I have a list of names."
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded19_Greed_Normal","Some are marked 'converted,' some 'resilient,' and some 'prospects.'"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded20_Pragmatic_Normal","There's a whole book of names here!"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded21_Lawful_Normal","We must take this to the authorities!"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded22_Helpful_Normal","There will be civil war if we do. People will kill their neighbors!"
"ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded23_Violent_Normal","War is coming whatever we do."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_1_Player_Normal","Carran!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_2_Player_Formal","Lord Carran!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_3_Carran_NPC","This isn't a good time."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_4_Player_Normal","We're aware - the city's full of Sorak pawns!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_5_Player_Formal","Indeed, and we have proof of an imminent Sorak attack!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_6_Carran_NPC","Surely you exaggerate!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_7_Player_Normal","Here! A list of all those under or soon to be under Sorak influence."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_8_Carran_NPC","What? Where did you find this?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_9_Player_Normal","Halman Summer's mansion. He was one of them!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_10_Carran_NPC","I can't believe it… all this time…"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_11_Player_Normal","There's more!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_12_Player_Normal","Everything suggests that the Soraks have the missing gems."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_13_Player_Normal","They had a map showing everywhere we found gems, plus two other places."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_14_Carran_NPC","Maraike's mercy!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_15_Carran_NPC","We must convene the Council, but… this really isn't the best time."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_16_Player_Normal","The Gallivan situation, I suppose?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_17_Player_Slang","Gallivan, eh? How is it going?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_18_Carran_NPC","All the city's clerics are working to resurrect the victims. I hope it's enough."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_19_Greed_Default","More than thirty? That's a lot of diamonds. And clerics."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_20_Carran_NPC","We didn't really have a choice. The Crown is going to pay."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_21_Greed_Default","What?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_22_Carran_NPC","The envoy from Gallivan was… adamant."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_23_Carran_NPC","The Princess took command of the situation…"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_24_Carran_NPC","…and told him Masgarth would pay to resurrect their people."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_25_Pragmatic_Default","So why the troops at the border?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_26_Carran_NPC","Let's call it… an incentive."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_27_Pragmatic_Default","Everything should be fine, then."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_28_Pragmatic_Default","The Principality resurrects the poison victims, Gallivan withdraws its troops."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_29_Carran_NPC","Let's hope so. We don't have any idea who's behind this."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_30_Carran_NPC","Though your little book of secrets here might help us with that."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_31_Violent_Default","So, the Principality is still drafting soldiers."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_32_Carran_NPC","To defend the city. "
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_33_Carran_NPC","The army left for the border as soon as we heard about the threat."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_34_Cynical_Default","So much for confidence."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_35_Carran_NPC","Smiles work better if you have a sword at your side."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_36_Greed_Default","So you're resurrecting Faisech?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_37_Greed_Default","How much is that? A thousand gold pieces?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_38_Carran_NPC","I know what you're going to say. So don't."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_39_Cynical_Default","And someone must pray for his soul… Imagine that!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_40_Carran_NPC","Marshal Sunblaze is taking care of the senior delegates personally."
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_41_Selfpres_Default","Wait a minute!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_42_Selfpres_Default","Where is this happening?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_43_Carran_NPC","In the Temple of Einar. You've been in their dispensary…"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_44_Carran_NPC","Wait, you don't… they died!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_45_Selfpres_Default","You think they'd stop at that?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_46_Pragmatic_NPC","Thirty-something people inside the most secure place in the Principality…"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_47_Pragmatic_NPC","More than thirty possible traitors in the most protected temple in the Principality…"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_48_Violent_NPC","…close to the Crown of the Magister?"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_49_Carran_NPC","No! No, no, no!"
"ReturnToCC_Carran_2_50_Authority_NPC","What are we waiting for?"
"ReturnToCC_Temple1_1_Authority_Default","Marshal!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple1_2_BericSunblaze_NPC","Greetings, friends!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple1_3_Authority_Default","Where are the delegates?"
"ReturnToCC_Temple1_4_BericSunblaze_NPC","In the dispensary."
"ReturnToCC_Temple1_5_BericSunblaze_NPC","What's going on?"
"ReturnToCC_Temple1_6_Friendly_Default","Are you all right?"
"ReturnToCC_Temple1_7_BericSunblaze_NPC","I just cast a resurrection spell… forgive me - it is rather draining."
"ReturnToCC_Temple1_8_BericSunblaze_NPC","Wait!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple1_9_Cynical_Normal","Feeling good, dead people?"
"ReturnToCC_Temple1_10_Cynical_Formal","All right, everyone, we know who you are."
"ReturnToCC_Temple1_11_SorakAgent_NPC","Attack!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple2_1_BericSunblaze_NPC","By Einar… Sorak agents, in the temple!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple2_2_Authority_Default","Where's the Crown?"
"ReturnToCC_Temple2_3_BericSunblaze_NPC","Take this key. I… can't run."
"ReturnToCC_Temple2_4_BericSunblaze_NPC","Follow the light!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple2_5_Authority_Default","Let's go!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple3_1_Authority_Default","There!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple3_2_Selfpres_Default","It's gone!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple3_3_Pragmatic_Default","Here! A secret passage?"
"ReturnToCC_Temple3_4_Selfpres_Default","In the middle of the temple?"
"ReturnToCC_Temple3_5_Authority_Default","How did they miss that?"
"ReturnToCC_Temple3_6_Pragmatic_Default","Doesn't matter now!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Pragmatic_Default","This is ancient - from the first centuries after the Cataclysm!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple3_8_Pragmatic_Default","No time for a history lesson!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Any_Default","They went this way!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple4_1_Any_Default","The city's Imperial Gate!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple4_2_Any_Default","They're here!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple4_3_Any_Default","They're trying to get away with the Crown!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple4_4_Any_Default","Protector!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple4_5_LeiraKean_NPC","We failed! They got away with it!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple4_6_Any_Default","No!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple4_7_Merton_NPC","They must not destroy the gate!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple4_8_Any_Default","It's not over! They must not destroy the gate!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple4_9_Merton_NPC","There's too many of them!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple9_Merton_NPC","Come on! Fight!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple5_1_Any_Default","Look!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple5_2_Any_Default","The Princess?"
"ReturnToCC_Temple5_3_Merton_NPC","Ha, ha, ha! Come on, old lady - time to show off!"
"ReturnToCC_Temple5_4_Princess_NPC","One day, Arwin Merton…"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter1_Princess_NPC","Don't look at me like that."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter2_Any_Default","Your Royal Highness…"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter3_Princess_NPC","…thank you is what you're looking for."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter4_Any_Default","Thank you."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter5_Pragmatic_Default","They took the Crown."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter6_Princess_NPC","Is this… evil god coming?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter7_Authority_Default","I suppose that's their plan."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter8_Pragmatic_Default","Can we follow them? "
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter9_Selfpres_Default","There's no way to know where they've gone."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter10_Selfpres_Default","There are so many gates."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter11_Pragmatic_Default","Close to the Rift, right? Where it all began?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter12_Authority_Default","No one knows exactly where the Rift was."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter13_Merton_NPC","In the Aer Elai, near the capital of Manacalon - but it's a vast area!"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter14_Pragmatic_Default","They must have scouted it and found a teleporter nearby."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter15_Selfpres_Default","So we're doomed?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter16_Authority_Default","What's going on?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter17_Merton_NPC","We're under attack!"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter18_Merton_NPC","Sleeper agents! Everywhere in the city!"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter19_Princess_Default","Are they so powerful, the Sorr-Akkath?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter20_History_Default","Your Royal Highness…"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter21_History_Default","We found this in Halman Summer's chambers, magically concealed."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter22_History_Default","Do you have any ideas?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter23_Princess_NPC","This is Sunset Peak, south of Aer Elai. "
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter24_Princess_NPC","I recognize this tower… or what's left of it."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter25_Princess_NPC","There is a gate not too far away."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter26_Princess_NPC","But who knows how the place looks like now?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter27_Authority_Default","We're running out of time! If there is a chance to stop them…"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter28_Violent_Default","They don't stand a chance against you!"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter29_Princess_NPC","Alas, I cannot go into the Badlands."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter30_Nosy_Default","What? Why?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter31_Princess_NPC","Long story short: it would kill me faster than any dark god."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter32_Princess_NPC","There's no time to explain - you have to trust me."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter33_Princess_NPC","Only you can save Solasta now."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter34_Selfpres_Default","Us? What about all your… heroes, and all?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter35_Princess_NPC","Marshal Sunblaze is weakened from casting Resurrection spells, and so are most of his clerics."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter36_Pragmatic_Default","Oh… they planned this as well, didn't they?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter37_Princess_NPC","All my best fighters and spellblades are on the border."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter38_Princess_NPC","Protector Kean is not what she used to be."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter39_Authority_Default","Merton? You coming?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter40_Princess_NPC","He's staying with me. Caer Cyflen is on fire, its streets full of Sorak pawns on a murder spree."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter41_Princess_NPC","The Crown needs you. I felt it, from the beginning."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter42_Princess_NPC","Kaseinax's spirit calls for you to save him from the darkness."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter43_Nosy_Default","The Magister? You knew him?"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter44_Princess_NPC","You're too curious for your own good."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter45_Authority_Default","So, Merton's staying."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter46_Merton_NPC","Can't say no to a princess. Especially that one."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter47_Authority_Default","Fine, then."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter48_Princess_NPC","I can only give you a few trinkets to help you in your endeavor."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter49_Princess_NPC","And my blessing."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter50_Sellsword_Default","My arm is yours, Princess."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter51_Aristocrat_Default","Serving you is the greatest honor, your royal highness."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter52_Spy_Default","You're definitely the best crowned head around."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter53_Academic_Default","To think that you knew the Magister? I have so many questions!"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter54_Lowlife_Default","That's more than enough, Princess. We'll do your dirty work."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter55_Lawkeeper_Default","We will prevail or die, your royal highness."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter56_Philosopher_Default","So powerful - and yet so helpless to save Solasta. Fascinating."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter57_AcolyteEinar_Default","Einar will be with us, your royal highness."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter58_AcolyteMaraike_Default","Maraike will be with us in life and death."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter59_AcolyteArun_Default","May Arun guide us all."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter60_AcolytePakri_Default","Justice will be served, your royal highness."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter61_Princess_NPC","You should rest and prepare yourselves."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter62_Authority_Default","Sleep, now? There's no time!"
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter63_Princess_NPC","You really should start admitting that you don't know everything."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter64_Princess_NPC","Rest now. Time will wait for you, I promise."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter65_Princess_NPC","I will speak the words that will activate the gate for Sunset Peak."
"ReturnToCC_Teleporter66_Princess_NPC","When you are ready, step onto the gate, and fulfill your destiny."
"ReturnToCC_TimeLapse1_Nosy_Default","Did she just… stop time?"
"ReturnToCC_TimeLapse2_Acolyte_Default","This is unnatural."
"ReturnToCC_TimeLapse3_Selfpres_Default","I won't be able to sleep now."
"ReturnToCC_TimeLapse4_Authority_Default","You know what's at stake. "
"ReturnToCC_TimeLapse5_Authority_Default","We'll need to be ready for anything."
"Mertonswife1_Bitterroot_NPC","Damned Soraks right under our noses, eh?"
"Mertonswife2_Bitterroot_NPC","It's worse than I thought. I met with this fake baron more than once recently..."
"Mertonswife3_Bitterroot_NPC","Didn't see a difference."
"Mertonswife4_Lawful_Normal","Nice to meet you, too."
"Mertonswife5_Lawful_Formal","And who might you be, lady?"
"Mertonswife6_Bitterroot_NPC","Call me Bitterroot."
"Mertonswife7_Nosy_Formal","That's a peculiar name."
"Mertonswife8_Nosy_Normal","So that's not your real name?"
"Mertonswife9_Bitterroot_NPC","It's the only name I need."
"Mertonswife10_Bitterroot_NPC","Tell me something."
"Mertonswife11_Bitterroot_NPC","You're bound to the Legacy Council, right?"
"Mertonswife12_Cynical_Normal","I knew these badges would help eventually."
"Mertonswife13_Friendly_Normal","Yes, we are. Interested in joining?"
"Mertonswife14_Bitterroot_NPC","Ever heard of Arwin Merton? He's probably marinating in some tavern in Caer Cyflen."
"Mertonswife15_Authority_Normal","We met him."
"Mertonswife16_Bitterroot_NPC","If you'd be so kind, I have something I'd like you to take back to him."
"Mertonswife17_Bitterroot_NPC","A message, and a gift."
"Mertonswife18_Violent_Normal","Why not go yourself?"
"Mertonswife19_Bitterroot_NPC","I'm not going to him. He needs to come to me."
"Mertonswife20_Helpful_Normal","A personal matter?"
"Mertonswife21_Helpful_Slang","He cheated on you or something?"
"Mertonswife22_Helpful_Formal","Sounds like a sensitive topic."
"Mertonswife23_Bitterroot_NPC","I'd rather not go into detail. "
"Mertonswife24_Authority_Slang","What's the gift?"
"Mertonswife25_Authority_Normal","What do we need to take back?"
"Mertonswife26_Bitterroot_NPC","A longsword."
"Mertonswife27_Pragmatic_Normal","Not too heavy. We could do that."
"Mertonswife28_Greed_Normal","But what's the reward?"
"Mertonswife29_Bitterroot_NPC","Ah - real heroes!"
"Mertonswife30_Bitterroot_NPC","I can give you the location of a... treasure."
"Mertonswife31_Cynical_Normal","Of course, everyone keeps a treasure map in their pocket, just in case..."
"Mertonswife32_Bitterroot_NPC","It's a Manacalon building in the Badlands."
"Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC","The Arcaneum wanted me to loot it."
"Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC2","Apparently, it was a Silent Whisper base before the Cataclysm."
"Mertonswife34_Greed_Normal","Heddlon Surespell would pay a fortune for what's inside."
"Mertonswife35_Bitterroot_NPC","But it's full of monsters. Too many for me."
"Mertonswife36_Friendly_Normal","We could team up."
"Mertonswife37_Bitterroot_NPC","I've... lost the taste for adventuring."
"Mertonswife38_Bitterroot_NPC","Do we have a deal?"
"Mertonswife39_Helpful_NPC","Sure."
"Mertonswife40_Selfpres_NPC","Not interested."
"Mertonswife41_Agree_NPC","Fine, what's the message?"
"Mertonswife42_Choice_Refuse","Sorry. We have more important things to do."
"Mertonswife43_Choice_Accept","As you wish."
"Mertonswife44_Biterroot_NPC","Tell him he still owes me a child, and I'm waiting. Here, in Coparann."
"Mertonswife45_Any_Normal","All right... we'll tell him that."
"Mertonswife46_Any_Formal","Fine, we'll take your message to him."
"Mertonswife47_Biterroot_NPC","Thank you. Here's the blade. And the map."
"Mertonswife48_Friendly_Normal","Farewell, Bitterroot."
"Mertonswife2_1_Any_Normal","Hello, Arwin."
"Mertonswife2_2_Merton_NPC","Arwin? We're friends now? "
"Mertonswife2_3_Merton_NPC","I'll keep calling you kid, I think."
"Mertonswife2_4_Any_Normal","Whatever."
"Mertonswife2_5_Any_Formal","Suit yourself."
"Mertonswife2_6_Any_Normal","We've been to Coparann - ring a bell?"
"Mertonswife2_7_Any_Formal","I suppose you know the name Coparann."
"Mertonswife2_8_Merton_NPC","You bet."
"Mertonswife2_9_Any_Normal","Apparently, you are indebted to someone there."
"Mertonswife2_10_Any_Normal","An elf ranger. She calls herself Bitterroot."
"Mertonswife2_11_Merton_NPC","Really?"
"Mertonswife2_12_Any_Normal","Something to do with her mood, maybe."
"Mertonswife2_13_Any_Normal","She said you owe her… a child."
"Mertonswife2_14_Merton_NPC","She's crazy."
"Mertonswife2_15_Any_Normal","We just said we'd bring the message. She's still waiting."
"Mertonswife2_16_Merton_NPC","Yeah… thanks for the message."
"Mertonswife2_17_Any_Normal","Want to tell us what this is about?"
"Mertonswife2_18_Any_Formal","Maybe you would like to share a story with us?"
"Mertonswife2_19_Merton_NPC","No. I don't."
"Mertonswife2_20_Any_Normal","You didn't take her child away from her?"
"Mertonswife2_21_Merton_NPC","You're out of line. I'd step back if I were you."
"Mertonswife2_22_Any_Normal","All right. It's none of our business."
"Mertonswife2_23_Any_Normal","She gave us this for you."
"Mertonswife2_24_Merton_NPC","What?"
"Mertonswife2_25_Merton_NPC","I don't believe it!"
"Mertonswife2_26_Merton_NPC","She went back for it…"
"Mertonswife2_27_Any_Normal","Feel more like talking now?"
"Mertonswife2_28_Merton_NPC","Get out!"
"LegendaryQuest_1_Merton_NPC","Hello again! I hear you're the terror of the Badlands."
"LegendaryQuest_2_Any_Default","We're getting by."
"LegendaryQuest_3_Any_Default","Did you hear about a lost god?"
"LegendaryQuest_4_Merton_NPC","Sure - if you're ready to die!"
"LegendaryQuest_5_Any_Default","We're not green anymore, Merton."
"LegendaryQuest_6_Merton_NPC","Fine, but the Lost God? That is the stuff of legend."
"LegendaryQuest_7_Merton_NPC","I've met a lot of people who wanted to find that temple."
"LegendaryQuest_8_Merton_NPC","At first I tried to help. No one ever came back."
"LegendaryQuest_9_Merton_NPC","So I decided to stop talking about it."
"LegendaryQuest_10_Merton_NPC","I felt… well…"
"LegendaryQuest_11_Any_Default","Responsible for their deaths?"
"LegendaryQuest_12_Merton_NPC","Responsible? No - they paid for their folly."
"LegendaryQuest_13_Merton_NPC","I just grew tired of repeating the same warning over and over."
"LegendaryQuest_14_Any_Default","Are we bothering you?"
"LegendaryQuest_15_Merton_NPC","You're always bothering me."
"LegendaryQuest_16_Any_Default","Let's go."
"LegendaryQuest_17_Merton_NPC","Oh, don't be so sensitive!"
"LegendaryQuest_18_Merton_NPC","All right - the temple is real. I've seen it."
"LegendaryQuest_19_Any_Default","You have?"
"LegendaryQuest_20_Merton_NPC","It was about fifteen years ago, but yes. I did."
"LegendaryQuest_21_Any_Default","And you didn't raid it?"
"LegendaryQuest_22_Merton_NPC","Well, ten of us found the place…"
"LegendaryQuest_23_Merton_NPC","…when I was the only one left, I came home."
"LegendaryQuest_24_Any_Default","The other nine died?"
"LegendaryQuest_25_Merton_NPC","Slaughtered. All of them."
"LegendaryQuest_26_Merton_NPC","Still interested?"
"LegendaryQuest_27_Any_Default","You think we're not strong enough?"
"LegendaryQuest_28_Merton_NPC","I don't know. You're the mighty Sorak killers, after all…"
"LegendaryQuest_29_Merton_NPC","…maybe with me… you'd have a chance."
"LegendaryQuest_30_Any_Default","You'd come with us?"
"LegendaryQuest_31_Merton_NPC","I wouldn't let anyone raid that temple without me."
"LegendaryQuest_32_Merton_NPC","You'd never find it, for a start."
"LegendaryQuest_33_Any_Default","Are you after the treasure?"
"LegendaryQuest_34_Merton_NPC","Who says there's any treasure?"
"LegendaryQuest_35_Merton_NPC","There's a monster - I know that."
"LegendaryQuest_36_Any_NPC","What is it?"
"LegendaryQuest_37_Merton_NPC","That, I don't know."
"LegendaryQuest_38_Merton_NPC","I just want to be there first. I want that on my tombstone."
"LegendaryQuest_39_Any_Default","Fair enough."
"LegendaryQuest_40_Merton_NPC","It's a long trip. If you're crazy enough to go, give me some time to pack my gear."
"LegendaryQuest_41_Merton_NPC","I need the rest of the day. I'll wait for you here."
"LegendaryQuest_42_Any_Default","Sure."
"LegendaryQuest_2_1_Authority_Normal","We're ready to take on that quest, Arwin."
"LegendaryQuest_2_2_Merton_NPC","Good for you!"
"LegendaryQuest_2_3_Friendly_Normal","Did you change your mind?"
"LegendaryQuest_2_4_Merton_NPC","No, no. I'm ready!"
"LegendaryQuest_2_5_Merton_NPC","Let's go!"
"LegendaryQuest_2_6_Lawful_Normal","Hey, we're supposed to go together, remember?"
"LegendaryQuest_2_7_Merton_NPC","Yeah, about that. I have to go to Coparann first."
"LegendaryQuest_2_8_Cynical_Normal","Oh - unfinished business, maybe?"
"LegendaryQuest_2_9_Merton_NPC","You know exactly what business."
"LegendaryQuest_2_10_Authority_Normal","So how about the quest?"
"LegendaryQuest_2_11_Merton_NPC","Your map has a location called Caer Elis."
"LegendaryQuest_2_12_History_Normal","It's just an old Manacalon name."
"LegendaryQuest_2_13_Merton_NPC","Maybe, but there is a ruin - you'll see it. It's Tirmarian."
"LegendaryQuest_2_14_Merton_NPC","I'll be waiting for you."
"LegendaryQuest_2_15_Selfpres_Normal","What if we don't come?"
"LegendaryQuest_2_16_Merton_NPC","Then damn the lot of you."
"LegendaryQuest_2_17_Authority_Normal","What we get there before you do?"
"LegendaryQuest_2_18_Merton_NPC","Ha, ha! As if you could!"
"LegendaryQuest_2_19_Merton_NPC","See you there!"
"LegendaryQuest_2_20_Selfpres_Normal","He's crazy. "
"LegendaryQuest_2_21_Pragmatic_Normal","And we're going with him."
"LegendaryQuest_3_1_Merton_NPC","See? I told you I'd be here."
"LegendaryQuest_3_2_Nosy_Normal","What have you been doing?"
"LegendaryQuest_3_3_Merton_NPC","Catching up with wildlife."
"LegendaryQuest_3_4_Merton_NPC","It used to be my thing."
"LegendaryQuest_3_5_Cynical_Normal","Camping in the Badlands? Really?"
"LegendaryQuest_3_6_Merton_NPC","Yep. Shadow Tamer, they called me."
"LegendaryQuest_3_7_Pragmatic_Normal","Fine, Shadow Tamer - where's the temple?"
"LegendaryQuest_3_8_Merton_NPC","Behind the mist."
"LegendaryQuest_4_1_Pragmatic_Normal","We're through the mist!"
"LegendaryQuest_4_2_Merton_NPC","Don't get too cocky. This is where my friends died last time."
"LegendaryQuest_4_3_Religion_Einar_Normal","Einar will guide us."
"LegendaryQuest_4_4_Religion_Maraike_Normal","Maraike is with us."
"LegendaryQuest_4_5_Religion_Pakri_Normal","Pakri will clear our minds."
"LegendaryQuest_4_6_Religion_Arun_Normal","Arun will guide our hearts."
"LegendaryQuest_4_7_Sellsword_Normal","No pain, no gain."
"LegendaryQuest_4_8_Selpres_Normal","Thanks for the encouragement."
"LegendaryQuest_4_9_Merton_NPC","Just saying…"
"LegendaryQuest_5_1_Selfpres_Normal","We did it!"
"LegendaryQuest_5_2_Merton_NPC","Yeah, we did!"
"LegendaryQuest_5_3_Merton_NPC","There's still the big one, in there!"
"LegendaryQuest_5_4_Pragmatic_Normal","Sure. It's not over yet."
"LegendaryQuest_5_5_Any_Normal","This is weird. I don't recognize any of these symbols."
"LegendaryQuest_5_6_Any_Normal","Was there really a lost god?"
"LegendaryQuest_5_7_History_Normal","I think I know what this was:"
"LegendaryQuest_5_8_History_Normal","A temple of Arivad!"
"LegendaryQuest_5_9_Einar_Normal","Einar protect us!"
"LegendaryQuest_5_10_Any_Normal","Isn't that one of the names of the Sorak god?"
"LegendaryQuest_5_11_History_Normal","Not before the Cataclysm."
"LegendaryQuest_5_12_History_Normal","Arivad was fierce and just on Tirmar - a god of inquisitors."
"LegendaryQuest_5_13_History_Normal","Before he was corrupted. "
"LegendaryQuest_5_14_History_Normal","His good side became Einar."
"LegendaryQuest_5_15_History_Normal","His bad side was absorbed by Sorr-Tarr and they became one."
"LegendaryQuest_5_16_Einar_Normal","The name of Arivad is cursed. This place is… evil."
"LegendaryQuest_5_17_History_Normal","This is just stone, transported here from Tirmar."
"LegendaryQuest_5_18_History_Normal","Whatever took place within these walls happened a millennium ago."
"LegendaryQuest_5_19_Einar_Normal","Such evil never fully disappears."
"LegendaryQuest_5_20_Lawful_Normal","Well, then - let's clean the place up!"
"LegendaryQuest_6_1_Merton_NPC","Well, I must say…"
"LegendaryQuest_6_2_Merton_NPC","You're the best team I ever had."
"LegendaryQuest_6_3_Friendly_Normal","Thanks!"
"LegendaryQuest_6_4_Friendly_Formal","From a living legend like you, that's a great compliment."
"LegendaryQuest_6_5_Merton_NPC","Now, it's time to take your reward."
"LegendaryQuest_6_6_Any_Normal","You're leaving?"
"LegendaryQuest_6_7_Merton_NPC","I told you. This is it for me - killing that remorhaz, climbing those stairs."
"LegendaryQuest_6_8_Merton_NPC","I need to tell someone. I'll see you back at Caer Cyflen."
"LegendaryQuest_6_9_Selfpres_Normal","Mysterious."
"LegendaryQuest_6_10_Pragmatic_Normal","Crazy but… a damn good ranger."
"LegendaryQuest_6_11_Nosy_Normal","He's going back to that Bitterroot woman."
"LegendaryQuest_6_12_Lawful_Normal","That's none of our business. "
"LegendaryQuest_6_13_Greed_Normal","Indeed. That chest on the other hand…"
"TheAerElai1_Nosy_Default","Look at that…"
"TheAerElai2_Nosy_Default","…the heart of the Badlands, almost the epicenter of the Cataclysm."
"TheAerElai3_Selfpres_Default","There's nothing left of the Old Empire."
"TheAerElai4_Authority_Default","All right, people - we're not here for the view."
"TheAerElai5_Arcana_Default","This wind… it's not natural."
"TheAerElai6_Arcana_Default","It's a mana wind. We can't use magic to get across."
"TheAerElai7_Cynical_Default","So, falling would be a bad idea, then."
"TheAerElai8_Lawful_Default","We've been through worse."
"TheAerElai9_Selfpres_Default","Watch out!"
"TheAerElai10_Nosy_Default","What kind of creature lives in a place like this?"
"TheAerElai11_Nature_Default","You got it: fire spiders."
"TheAerElai12_Selfpres_Default","Over there! Soraks!"
"TheAerElai13_Einar_Default","They don't need to hide here."
"TheAerElai14_Pragmatic_Default","They're not paying attention. What are they doing?"
"TheAerElai15_Cynical_Default","Dropping gigantic bones into lava?"
"TheAerElai16_Pragmatic_Default","Why?"
"TheAerElai17_Nature_Default","They're not just any bones…"
"TheAerElai18_Nature_Default","…those are dragon bones!"
"TheAerElai19_Pragmatic_Default","How many dragons died here?"
"TheAerElai20_Arcana_Default","Remember what the Princess said. The place is deadly to them."
"TheAerElai21_Authority_Default","There's no other way - we need to get up there!"
"TheAerElai22_Cynical_Default","Without being shot at, preferably?"
"TheAerElai23_Cynical_Default","More dragon bones?"
"TheAerElai24_Pragmatic_Default","That's really what they were doing - cleaning up the place!"
"TheAerElai25_Authority_Default","They were destroying the bones!"
"TheAerElai26_Nosy_Default","How do you know?"
"TheAerElai27_Arcana_Default","The bones are a threat to them!"
"TheAerElai28_Pragmatic_Default","I don't follow."
"TheAerElai29_Arcana_Default","These are the remains of the Masters of the Arcaneum."
"TheAerElai30_Pragmatic_Default","Dragons? All of them?"
"TheAerElai31_Arcana_Default","The Master of Abjuration was no exception. They were all dragons."
"TheAerElai32_Arcana_Default","Even the Magister."
"TheAerElai33_Arcana_Default","And his bones are among those."
"TheAerElai34_Pragmatic_Default","I thought I felt something, but…"
"TheAerElai35_Cynical_Default","Definitely."
"TheAerElai36_Authority_Default","We need to search the bones."
"TheAerElai37_Any_Default","Here!"
"TheAerElai38_Any2_Default","A tooth?"
"TheAerElai39_Any3_Default","It calls to me…"
"TheAerElai40_Magister_NPC","Let me… touch my Crown…"
"TheAerElai41_Any_Default","Did you hear that?"
"TheAerElai42_Any2_Default","I did."
"TheAerElai43_Any3_Default","He wants to touch the Crown."
"TheAerElai44_Any4_Default","The tooth? Just one little tooth?"
"TheAerElai45_Any3_Default","That's why the Soraks want to destroy the bones."
"TheAerElai46_Any2_Default","What will happen if we succeed?"
"TheAerElai47_Magister_NPC","Let me… touch my Crown…"
"TheAerElai48_Authority_Default","There's only one way to find out."
"TheAerElai49_Selfpres_Default","This place never ends!"
"TheAerElai50_Any2_Default","This is the way - I can hear the Crown!"
"TheAerElai51_Any3_Default","Yes! We must go on!"
"TheAerElai52_Selfpres_Default","Are we walking into some gigantic trap?"
"TheAerElai53_Pragmatic_Default","The Soraks are doing all they can to stop us!"
"TheAerElai54_Authority_Default","Come on - don't falter now!"
"TheAerElai55_Any_Default","This is it - the Rift!"
"TheAerElai56_Selfpres_Default","Is it open again?"
"TheAerElai57_Any_Default","Hard to say. "
"TheAerElai58_Any_Default","I see a bunch of Soraks, but not the countless horde they're expecting."
"TheAerElai59_Cynical_Default","And no god."
"TheAerElai60_Any_Default","The Crown!"
"TheAerElai61_Any_Default","They're doing it - the damn ritual!"
"TheAerElai62_Any_Default","This is it, friends. This is when we make history - or die."
"TheAerElai63_AcolyteEinar_Default","Einar guide us!"
"TheAerElai64_AcolyteMaraike_Default","Maraike watch over us!"

"TheAerElai75_Any2_Default","The Magister!"
"TheAerElai76_Any2_Default","He's coming back to life!"
"TheAerElai77_Magister_NPC","Hold."
"TheAerElai78_Any3_Default","What?"
"TheAerElai79_Any4_Default","The Rift, it's open!"
"TheAerElai80_Any3_Default","No! "
"TheAerElai81_Magister_NPC","HOLD."
"TheAerElai82_Any_Default","I thought that was it!"
"TheAerElai83_Any2_Default","He said hold! We need to hold!"
"TheAerElai84_Any_Default","Against a whole army?"
"TheAerElai85_Any3_Default","Look!"
"TheAerElai86_Any3_Default","He's closing the Rift!"
"TheAerElai87_Authority_Default","Protect the Magister - nothing else matters!"
"TheAerElai88_Magister_NPC","I was right about you."
"TheAerElai89_Magister_NPC","I must go, now."

"Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Starter_Default","Hello Annie."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Quartermaster_NPC","You're back! How did it go?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Starter_Default","Well… Captain Henrik is dead, I'm sorry."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Quartermaster_NPC","Oh. Who's in charge, then?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_Starter_Default","You might have to wait before going to Caer Lem, I'm afraid."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Quartermaster_NPC","I see."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Quartermaster_NPC","Well, not your fault. Thanks for the heads-up."
"Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Starter_Default","You're welcome."
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_1_Starter_Default","We wanted to talk about Caer Lem."
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_2_Quartermaster_NPC","I'm all ears."
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_3_Starter_Default","No one's there anymore…"
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_4_Quartermaster_NPC","Ah, you want to claim the place?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_5_Starter_Default","How does it work again?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_6_Quartermaster_NPC","We go there and scavenge everything you didn't take, then you get a percentage."
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_7_Starter_Default","We can't promise you it's safe."
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_8_Quartermaster_NPC","It never is."
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_9_Quartermaster_NPC","Once we get there, we'll set up an outpost of our own."
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_10_Quartermaster_NPC","I'll check with the Council first, but thanks anyway."
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_11_Starter_Default","What do we do next?"
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_12_Quartermaster_NPC","Once we've done our work, I'll let you know."
"Scavengers_Dialog_03_13_Quartermaster_NPC","You'll just have to come by and collect your share."
"Generic_False_Gem_Thread_01","I think… this is what the Crown showed me."
"Generic_False_Gem_Thread_02","So, not one of the gems?"
"Generic_False_Gem_Thread_03","Obviously."
"Generic_False_Gem_Thread_04","Do you feel anything else?"
"Generic_False_Gem_Thread_05","Yes."
"Generic_False_Gem_Thread_06","Alright - let's go, then."
"Generic_False_Gem_Thread_07","I'm afraid not."
"Generic_False_Gem_Thread_08","That's a problem."
"Generic_False_Gem_Thread_09","Let's go back to the Council. We have to tell them."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_1_Annie_NPC","I have great need of you, my friends."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_2_Any_Default","What's going on?"
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_3_Annie_NPC","One of our teams has been attacked and is stranded in the Badlands."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_4_Any_Default","Oh, where?"
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_5_Annie_NPC","It's a bit beyond Caer Lem, not that far into the Badlands."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_6_Annie_NPC","They found a legendary place - the lost city of Telema!"
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_7_Annie_NPC","No one really knows what it was, but the name appears in many old texts."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_8_Annie_NPC","So they started exploring."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_9_Annie_NPC","One of them came back yesterday..."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_10_Annie_NPC","...he had lost an arm."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_11_Annie_NPC","He told me they'd been attacked and his leader sent him to get help."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_12_Annie_NPC","Alas, Telema is many days from here."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_13_Any_Default","Do you think they're still alive?"
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_14_Annie_NPC","I don't know, but I'd like you to go and find out."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_15_Annie_NPC","If they're alive, bring them back."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_16_Annie_NPC","If not... I'll send for their bodies."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_17_Annie_NPC","Anyway, the place is yours to explore. I expect it contains many treasures."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_18_Any_Default","Well, I suppose we can do that for our friends the Scavengers."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_19_Annie_NPC","That would make you part of the family, I promise."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_20_Any_Default","All right, let's hope we find them alive."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_1_Cynical_Default","Good old Hector, eh?"
"ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_2_Any_Default","Let's search him. We might find something to explain all this."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_3_Any_Default","Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_4_Any_Default","Soraks?"
"ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_5_Any_Default","At least we saved two of them."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_6_Cynical_Default","The best ones, I'm sure."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_7_Judgmental_Default","Shut up!"
"ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_8_Any_Default","Let's go back and tell Annie."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_End_1_Annie_NPC","My friends, you did it!"
"ScavengersQuestTelema_End_2_Any_Default","Lena and Dek are already here?"
"ScavengersQuestTelema_End_3_Annie_NPC","I received a message. They're safely back in Coparann."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_End_4_Any_Default","So they told you about Hector."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_End_5_Annie_NPC","Yes. Another friend lost..."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_End_6_Any_Default","You mean Arwin Merton?"
"ScavengersQuestTelema_End_7_Annie_NPC","Never mind me. This was the Soraks, I know."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_End_8_Any_Default","Actually, we found proof that it was."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_End_9_Annie_NPC","Oh... and you saved two of my kids, I shall never forget."
"ScavengersQuestTelema_End_10_Any_Default","We must go, Annie. See you!"
"ScavengersCoparann_1_Any_Default","Are you the local… boss of the Scavengers?"
"ScavengersCoparann_2_Milan_NPC","You could say that."
"ScavengersCoparann_3_Milan_NPC","Not boss of much, I'm afraid."
"ScavengersCoparann_4_Milan_NPC","We used to have adventurers raiding around here, but now there's just one."
"ScavengersCoparann_5_Any_Default","One?"
"ScavengersCoparann_6_Milan_NPC","She's around somewhere. You might run into her."
"ScavengersCoparann_7_Any_Default","We did find an interesting place, though - an old Tirmarian monastery."
"ScavengersCoparann_8_Milan_NPC","Yeah?"
"ScavengersCoparann_9_Milan_NPC","Tell me where. We'll take care of it."
"PriestessOfPakri1_Priestess_NPC","The law provides, adventurers!"

"PriestOfMaraike4_Priest_NPC","Walk in life, adventurers."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_1_MayorBrightspark_NPC","Ah - deputies!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_2_Philosopher_Default","Clear skies, lady mayor!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_3_MayorBrightspark_NPC","Hem. Well, a renowned mind of Caer Cyflen has asked to see you."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_4_MayorBrightspark_NPC","I believe you know him - Galeafin Pureheart?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_5_Philosopher_Default","Indeed! A very fine mind and a beloved teacher!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_6_MayorBrightspark_NPC","Well, he's heard about your exploits and would like to talk to you."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_7_Philosopher_Default","Gladly! It will be good to see my old teacher! Clear skies!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_8_MayorBrightspark_NPC","Clear skies! "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_1_Philosopher_Default","Clear skies! We would like to meet Master Pureheart!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_2_Butler_NPC","You don't have an appointment? Who shall I announce?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_3_Philosopher_Default","A companion of the third enlightenment!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_4_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","Clear skies, my student! To what do I owe the pleasure? "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_5_Philosopher_Default","Mayor Bright-Spark asked us to visit you."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_6_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","Ah yes, this matter for the Council! "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_7_Philosopher_Default","What matter? "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_8_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","The matter of evil, and what motivates people to choose evil."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_9_Philosopher_Default","A weighty matter indeed!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_10_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","Yes, and I need your help! Tell me about your missions!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_11_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","I am cleared to hear everything! "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_12_Philosopher_Default","Well… it all began at Caer Lem…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_13_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","Many thanks! You gave me much to ponder. We shall meet again soon!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_14_Philosopher_Normal","Clear skies, master!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_15_GaleafinPureheart_NPC","Clear skies to you!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_1_Philosopher_Normal","Clear skies, Master Pureheart. You sent for us? "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC","Yes, indeed! I would like more…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC","…details about your dealings with the Sorr-Akkath."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_4_Philosopher_Normal","Certainly. How goes your research?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC","You gave me much to consider. But I need more…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_6_Galeafin_NPC","…hence this invitation"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC","There is much talk about Sorr-Akkath cruelty…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC","Did you witness it first hand?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_9_Philosopher_Normal","Alas, quite often! When they fight…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_10_Philosopher_Normal","They enjoy inflicting pain before killing!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC","But why, why so much suffering? "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_12_Philosopher_Normal","We think it is the will of their god, Sorr-Tarr."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_13_Galeafin_NPC","He expects them to spread terror…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_14_Philosopher_Normal","…so he can influence and…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_15_Philosopher_Normal","…pervert humans… control them."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_16_Galeafin_NPC","Humans, you say? "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_17_Philosopher_Normal","Yes - others seem less susceptible…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_18_Philosopher_Normal","… from what we understand of them!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_19_Galeafin_NPC","And so he relies on cruelty to… to do what? "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_20_Philosopher_Normal","To gain a hold! Those he can't control, he blackmails or breaks their will!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_21_Galeafin_NPC","Fascinating…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_22_Philosopher_Normal","Does it help?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_23_Galeafin_NPC","Oh, yes, very much."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_24_Galeafin_NPC","Thank you very much."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_25_Philosopher_Normal","Until next time, then, Master!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_1_Philosopher_Default","Clear skies, Master!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC","Clear skies!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC","We live in fascinating times!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_4_Philosopher_Default","Too true!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC","So, about our last meeting… "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_6_Philsopher_Insight_Success_Automatic_Default","Still troubled, Master?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC","Yes, indeed."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC","I have had occasion to witness… certain things."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_9_Philosopher_Default","What things?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_10_Galeafin_NPC","I am not entirely sure. Violent rituals…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC","…they reminded me of what you said."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_12_Galeafin_NPC","About cruelty and Sorr-Tarr's ways."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_13_Philosopher_Default","Master! You're scaring me, now!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_14_Galeafin_NPC","I need to think! Can you come back tomorrow?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_15_Philosopher_Default","Of course!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_16_Any_Default","You realize something very bad might be happening to him?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_17_Philosopher_Default","I know. Let's just… come back tomorrow."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_1_Philosopher_Default","Clear skies! "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_2_Galeafin_NPC","Ah, my friend. Let me introduce Lady Illoreth, my paramour! "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_3_Philosopher_Default","Master?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_4_Illoreth_NPC","Clear skies, senior deputies!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_5_Philosopher_Default","Why do you call us that? "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_6_Illoreth_NPC","Because you are the reason I was sent after Galeafin, the most gentle soul on Solasta."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_7_InsightSuccessDC15_Default","I knew there was some treachery afoot here!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_8_InsightFailDC15_Default","What?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_9_Philosopher_Default","You'd better explain yourself quickly!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_10_Illoreth_NPC","I am an infiltrator from the Coven of Arivad!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_11_Selfpres_Default","They're here in Caer Cyflen?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_12_Illoreth_NPC","I was to seduce Galeafin to make him work for us!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_13_Illoreth_NPC","But instead, he changed me!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_14_Illoreth_NPC","He showed me that even a corrupted soul like mine still had some good. "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_15_Illoreth_NPC","And I won't let any harm come to him!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_16_Philosopher_Default","How can we believe you?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_17_Illoreth_NPC","I am not the danger! "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_18_Illoreth_NPC","The Coven will soon ask me to bring him in to turn him!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_19_Philosopher_Default","And?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_20_Illoreth_NPC","I can take you there - right to a splinter cell of the Coven!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_21_InsightSuccessDC15_Default","What do you want? "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_22_Illoreth_NPC","Just to be free - to make a new life somewhere else."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_23_Illoreth_NPC","We are too well known to stay here, but we want to stay together!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_24_Illoreth_NPC","The Coven knew of your mission and sent me to get information from you…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_25_Illoreth_NPC","I am not sure I am the only agent who knows…"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_26_Illoreth_NPC","…and Galeafin must disappear to be safe."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_27_Philosopher_Default","Do you truly want to leave, Master?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_28_Galeafin_NPC","Yes. Where Illoreth goes, I shall follow! "
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_29_Philosopher_Default","Very well, we shall come when you send for us!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_1_Philosopher_Default","Is it time?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_3_Philosopher_Default","And once inside?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_4_Illoreth_NPC","Wait for my signal!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_5_Illoreth_NPC","And until then, let me speak."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_1_Guard_NPC","State your business!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_2_Illoreth_NPC","Glory of souls!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_3_Guard_NPC","Power to the One!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_4_Illoreth_NPC","We're running late! Are we the last?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_5_Guard_NPC","Yes! All are awaiting your guest."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_7_Illoreth_NPC","New recruits."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_8_Guard_NPC","It's one at a time, you know the rules!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_9_Illoreth_NPC","Indeed, I know them."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_10_Illoreth_BANTER","Follow me to the basement."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_11_Sarcastic_BANTER","Let me guess - that was the signal!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_1_Any_Default","Look at this! Marshal Sunblaze will be delighted!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_2_Cynical_Default","Or scared to death!"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_3_Selfpres_Default","Where's Illoreth?"
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_4_Any_Default","I suppose she grabbed her reward… she ran."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_5_Philosopher_Default","Farewell, Master."
"PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_6_Philosopher_Default","May your wisdom serve you well, now."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_01_Default","What's this? A shrine?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_02_Default","Someone here worshipped Arun, a long time ago."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_03_Default","That someone ruined their own shrine?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_04_Default","Maybe it was just the cataclysm."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_05_Default","There's a small chest, here."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_1_Acolyte_Default","Clear skies, Chaplain Lark! You wanted to see me? "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_2_DalonLark_NPC","Clear skies! Yes, thank you for coming so fast."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_3_DalonLark_NPC","Remember that monastery near Coparann?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_4_Acolyte_Default","The Tirmarian ruins? Of course."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_5_DalonLark_NPC","There was a cemetery there."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_6_Acolyte_Default","Chaplain Ardentfire, Priest of Arun, would like to meet you about it."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_7_DalonLark_NPC","I shall go to him right away! Clear skies! "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_8_Acolyte_Default","Even if I don't pray to Arun, I'm happy to be of service."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_9_DalonLark_NPC","Clear skies! Einar guards you all! "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC","Ah, there you are!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default","Chaplain Dalon Lark told us you'd like to talk?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC","Many thanks for coming! "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Rogar_NPC","It's about the Sunblaze Monastery."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Acolyte_Default","We're all ears!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC","The Scavengers said that many tombs in the cemetery bore the name of the Darwaz family."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Acolyte_Default","And?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_8_Rogar_NPC","Emtan Darwaz ruled this monastery…"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_9_Rogar_NPC","He was a renowned prelate on Tirmar."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_10_Rogar_NPC","The heads of the Church searched for him for years."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_11_Rogar_NPC","Then he was considered to be lost, either left on the home world…"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_12_Rogar_NPC","…or killed in the Cataclysm."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_13_Rogar_NPC","Now, we know he was alive - he buried his brothers and family in the Badlands!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_14_Acolyte_Default","A sad tale, for sure."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_15_Rogar_NPC","Worse. As this cursed symbol suggests."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_16_Rogar_NPC","I prayed for his soul, and Arun sent me a sign."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_17_Acolyte_Default","A sign?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_18_Rogar_NPC","Chaplain Darwaz' soul never joined Arun. It is trapped."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_19_Rogar_NPC","He might have cursed his own symbol."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_20_Rogar_NPC","The souls of his brothers too, wander, somewhere in this land."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_21_Rogar_NPC","Someone needs to go and cleanse their remains with holy water."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_22_Acolyte_Default","Will that suffice?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_23_Rogar_NPC","Not if Emtan is indeed cursed, his soul will be too angry."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_24_Rogar_NPC","Then you'll need to reason with him. I imbued his symbol with Arun's magic - use it as proof."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_25_Acolyte_Default","And if he doesn't listen to reason? "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_26_Rogar_NPC","Then - and only then - should you destroy him. "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_27_Acolyte_Default","We will do what is necessary."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_28_Rogar_NPC","May Arun's fire warm your heart! "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_29_Acolyte_Default","Clear skies!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_1_Sarcastic_Default","Did we forget to close the door on our last visit? "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_2_HighestIntOrAny_Default","Never opened it!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_3_Sarcastic_Default","Well, someone's dropped by!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_5_Acolyte_Default","Let's cleanse those tombs with holy water!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_6_Sarcastic_Default","Not many remains left for the prayer!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_7_Acolyte_Default","You had to say it! Get ready, people!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_8_Sarcastic_Default","We're not going to try talking to them first? "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9a_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Success_Default","Zombies don't talk!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9b_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Failure_Default","No harm in trying, I guess."
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_11_Acolyte_Default","May the light of the gods free your souls!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_12_Sarcastic_Default","Sheesh! Don't pray for me if I die! "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_1_Emtan_NPC","Who are you to disturb our eternal rest?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_2_Acolyte_Default","A follower of the gods, hoping to save your soul!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_3_Emtan_NPC","There are no gods in this place, fool! "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_4_Acolyte_Default","Do you truly believe that? "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Emtan_NPC","Of course! Otherwise, they would have answered us in our hour of need! "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Acolyte_Default","Did they not? "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5b_Emtan_NPC","I prayed and never got an answer!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6a_Acolyte_Default","Yes, it did!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7a_Emtan_NPC","Liar!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8a_Acolyte_Default","Did you not have water and the means to grow food?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9a_Emtan_NPC","Barely!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8b_Acolyte_Default","Were monsters not kept at bay from your valley?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9b_Emtan_NPC","We heard them roam at night! "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8c_Acolyte_Default","Weren't you spared the worst of the mana collapse?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9c_Emtan_NPC","What?"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_10_Acolyte_Default","And yet you survived how many years here? "
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_11_Emtan_NPC","But my prayers weren't answered!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_12_Acolyte_Default","Yes, they were! You were just too mad with grief to see it!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6b_Acolyte_Default","Behold, the power of Arun, apostate!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7b_Emtan_NPC","It won't work, you fool!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_13_Emtan_NPC","Arun! The lord is still here!"
"BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_14_Acolyte_Default","It is time for you to enjoy your final rest, Emtan Darwaz, Acolyte of Arun!"
"BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_15_Emtan_NPC","Thank you…"
"BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Acolyt_Normal","Clear skies, Chaplain Ardentfire!"
"BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC","Clear skies! Did you bring peace to those troubled souls? "
"BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default","Yes, all of them are with the gods now! "
"BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC","And Emtan?"
"BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Acolyt_Normal","Saved. He is with Arun."
"BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Rogar_NPC","Many thanks, I will call his name during prayers!"
"BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC","Tragedy. The curse of Sorr-Tarr hurts us, still."
"BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Failed","We couldn't bring him back. He's gone."
"Optional_Spy_Quest1_Belmont_NPC","You? I know you!"
"Optional_Spy_Quest2_Spy_Default","What?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest3_Belmont_NPC","You were at the embassy! An aide or something… "
"Optional_Spy_Quest4_Spy_Default","You're mistaken. I'm a Council deputy."
"Optional_Spy_Quest5_Belmont_NPC","You can't fool me, I never forget a face."
"Optional_Spy_Quest6_Anyother_Default","What's going on, friend?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest7_Spy_Default","Never mind."
"Optional_Spy_Quest8_Belmont_NPC","That same week, the Gallivan envoy somehow got hold of our plans for the trade treaty… "
"Optional_Spy_Quest9_Spy_Default","Stop bothering us - we're guests of the princess."
"Optional_Spy_Quest10_Noble_Default","He's a Belmont. Be careful - they're a powerful family in the Snow Alliance."
"Optional_Spy_Quest11_Belmont_NPC","This isn't over. Now I found you, we'll settle this!"
"Optional_Spy_Quest12_Anyother_Default","Anything we should know?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest13_Spy_Default","Old story."
"Optional_Spy_Quest14_Anyother_Default","Look, if this is going to be a problem, we need to fix it - together."
"Optional_Spy_Quest15_Anyother_Default","I agree."
"Optional_Spy_Quest16_Spy_Default","All right, then I'll need to see someone at the Gallivan embassy."
"Optional_Spy_Quest17_Guard_NPC","Who goes there?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest18_Spy_Default","I'd like to see Ambassador Crawley."
"Optional_Spy_Quest19_Guard_NPC","Council business?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest20_Spy_Default","Inaudible"
"Optional_Spy_Quest21_Guard_NPC","Follow me."
"Optional_Spy_Quest22_Anyother_Default","Just like that?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest23_Spy_Default","Shut up and follow."
"Optional_Spy_Quest24_Joran_NPC","I'll be damned. Senior deputy of the Legacy Council."
"Optional_Spy_Quest25_Spy_Default","Nice to see you, too."
"Optional_Spy_Quest26_Joran_NPC","Can't say I expected your visit."
"Optional_Spy_Quest27_Spy_Default","I bumped into Belmont at the Palace residence."
"Optional_Spy_Quest28_Joran_NPC","And?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest29_Spy_Default","He seems to suspect me over the stolen treaty plans."
"Optional_Spy_Quest30_Joran_NPC","Seems to?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest31_Spy_Default","He's pretty eager to pin it on me."
"Optional_Spy_Quest32_Joran_NPC","We can't let that happen."
"Optional_Spy_Quest33_Spy_Default","That's why I'm here."
"Optional_Spy_Quest34_Joran_NPC","Them?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest35_Spy_Default","Friends. Trustworthy."
"Optional_Spy_Quest36_Joran_NPC","You have to take him out."
"Optional_Spy_Quest37_Joran_NPC","I can suggest a course of action."
"Optional_Spy_Quest38_Joran_NPC","You just need to plant something in the New Empire's embassy."
"Optional_Spy_Quest39_Spy_Default","Oh, is that all?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest40_Joran_NPC","Unless you have friends in the Silent Whisper."
"Optional_Spy_Quest41_Spy_Default","I might."
"Optional_Spy_Quest42_Joran_NPC","Once it's in the right hands, this will kill our friend Belmont's credibility."
"Optional_Spy_Quest43_Spy_Default","It looks like you have this all figured out."
"Optional_Spy_Quest44_Joran_NPC","I always plan for every contingency."
"Optional_Spy_Quest45_Joran_NPC","We should go."
"Optional_Spy_Quest46_Joran_NPC","Then this time it's farewell for good."
"Optional_Spy_Quest47_Selfpres_Default","You really want to break into the New Empire's embassy?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest48_Pragmatic_Default","This is crazy."
"Optional_Spy_Quest49_Spy_DaliatLives","We can ask Daliat. I think he'll help us."
"Optional_Spy_Quest50_Starter_Normal","That's not an embassy."
"Optional_Spy_Quest51_Spy_Normal","Just not its best side."
"Optional_Spy_Quest52_Noble_Slang","Sewers? Really? How did you know about this?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest53_Spy_Slang","Mind your own business. This way. Stay low."
"Optional_Spy_Quest54_Spy_Formal","Remember, if we're discovered, we're as good as dead."
"Optional_Spy_Quest55_Spy_Formal","This is it."
"Optional_Spy_Quest56_Spy_Normal","Let's hope this works."
"Optional_Spy_Quest57_Spy_Slang","Let's get out of here."
"Optional_Spy_Quest58_Daliat_NPC","Greetings, colleague."
"Optional_Spy_Quest59_Spy_Default","I'm not your colleague, Daliat. You know that."
"Optional_Spy_Quest60_Daliat_NPC","Sure. What can I do for you?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest61_Spy_Default","You know Lord Belmont?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest62_Daliat_NPC","Ambassador Belmont? Of course."
"Optional_Spy_Quest63_Spy_Default","We have something on Belmont that you might like. Not flattering."
"Optional_Spy_Quest64_Daliat_NPC","Nice. What's the catch?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest65_Spy_Default","I need you to release it right away."
"Optional_Spy_Quest66_Daliat_NPC","Right now? No long-term leverage?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest67_Spy_Default","That's right."
"Optional_Spy_Quest68_Daliat_NPC","I'll need you to do something for me, then."
"Optional_Spy_Quest69_Spy_Default","I'm listening."
"Optional_Spy_Quest70_Daliat_NPC","Some… former colleagues are running an operation from a base nearby."
"Optional_Spy_Quest71_Daliat_NPC","I need them dead."
"Optional_Spy_Quest72_Spy_Default","We're not murderers."
"Optional_Spy_Quest73_Daliat_NPC","They're traitors to the Silent Whisper. Ruthless bastards, too."
"Optional_Spy_Quest74_Spy_Default","Enough to die, just like that?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest75_Daliat_Default","Your choice. Do this for me and I'll take care of the Belmont thing."
"Optional_Spy_Quest76_Spy_Default","Fair enough."
"Optional_Spy_Quest77_Spy_Default","Hey! Any news?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest78_Daliat_NPC","It's done. Your… friends won't be a problem anymore."
"Optional_Spy_Quest79_Spy_Default","Good! I knew I could depend on you."
"Optional_Spy_Quest80_Daliat_NPC","That tip on Belmont is so good. He's as good as dead."
"Optional_Spy_Quest81_Daliat_NPC","Pleasure working with you, my friends."
"Optional_Spy_Quest82_Spy_Default","See you, Daliat."
"Optional_Spy_Quest83_Spy_Default","Is Lord Belmont around?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest84_Butler_NPC","He had to… return home."
"Optional_Spy_Quest85_Spy_Default","In a rush?"
"Optional_Spy_Quest86_Butler_NPC","Indeed."
"Optional_Spy_Quest87_Spy_Default","Thank you, Ravensworth."
"Optional_Spy_Quest88_Butler_NPC","You're welcome, deputies."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_1_Bagmordah_NPC","Clear skies, friends! I have a letter for someone who fought at Sandreed."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_2_Sellsword_Normal","That'd be me. Who wrote me?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_3_Bagmordah_NPC","Mildred Warmhearth, innkeeper at Coparann's Strike True tavern. Know her?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_4_Sellsword_Normal","Sure do. Well, friends, who's in for a trip back there?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Clear skies to you, adventurers! You got my letter?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_6_Sellsword_Normal","Clear skies! What's it all about?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Well, I knew your parents - and I know about the events that led to their deaths!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_8_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","You knew my parents? "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_9_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","What events?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","Their deaths?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_11_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","You knew my parents? "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Sure did. They had a house in the Vale, you know. "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_13_Sellsword_Normal","A house?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","I wasn't sure the first time I saw you… now I am."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Your parents were merchants, and you sometimes traveled with them."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","They worked a circuit from the Principality to the Marches."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","They were shrewd and successful. "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_18_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","So the house belongs to you now, I guess! "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_19_ChoiceB_Normal","What events? What are you talking about?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_20_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Fifteen years ago, Coparann was threatened by an orcish horde."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_21_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","They hit us hard, and almost overran the defenses!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_22_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","If the Stonefist company hadn't shown up when they did…"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_23_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","They broke the siege, but we'd already lost a lot of people."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_24_ChoiceC_Normal","How did they die?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_25_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","They died right after the siege. "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_26_Sellsword_Sellsword","After? Not during? "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_27_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","No… I… How can I put this?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_28_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Success","They were… responsible. "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_29_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Fail","Come on - spit it out!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_30_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","Well, your parents had been spying for the orcs!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_31_Sellsword_Sellsword","What? No! How? Who said? "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_32_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","That's the hardest part."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_33_Sellsword_Sellsword","What do you mean?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_34_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","It was you. Your testimony sealed their fate."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_35_Sellsword_Sellsword","What? Me? How?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_36_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","A seemingly innocent remark, but it led the Ceannard's spymaster to suspect your parents."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_37_Sellsword_Sellsword","How is it possible that I don't remember any of it?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_38_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","The Ceannard took pity on you and made you drink an elixir of forgetfulness."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_39_Sellsword_Sellsword","Very potent, clearly. I don't remember shit from my childhood."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_40_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","Yes. The Ceannard miscalculated the dose."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_41_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","The Baron sent you away, and provided for your education."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_42_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","He was a former mercenary, and he sent you to learn the same trade. "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_43_Sellsword_Sellsword","I guess I should thank him for bleeding in Sandreed… so, there's a house?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_44_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","All yours! No one knew where to find you until now. It's been kept in good order, waiting."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_45_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","Your parents gave me this before they went to meet their fate."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_46_Sellsword_Sellsword","What does that mean, ""resist temptation""? "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_47_Any_Insight_25_Success_Any_Insight_25_Success","Bribery or Sorak evil perhaps?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_48_Any_Insight_25_Failure_Any_Insight_25_Failure","Bribery?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_49_Sellsword_Sellsword","It was orcs! Let's go search the house for clues!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_50_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth","You should tell Sergeant Nikannen who you are, by the way. I told him you'd come."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_1_Sellsword_Slang","Clear skies to you, Sarge!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC","You, too! What can I do for you today, my friend? "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_3_Sellsword_Normal","I need the keys to my house in the Vale. Mildred told me."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_4_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Oh, it's you? You've grown - well, of course you have! Here - take this note to the Archivist!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_5_Sellsword_Normal","Thanks, Sarge!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_1_Sellsword_Slang","Clear skies, Master Archivist!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_2_AlanMiller_NPC","Clear skies! What can I do for you? "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_3_Sellsword_Normal","Here - from Sergeant Nikannen!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_4_AlanMiller_NPC","I see! Give me a moment, I just need to go into the archives."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_5_AlanMiller_NPC","Here you go! "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_6_Sellsword_Normal","Thanks! Clear skies!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_1_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal","Nice house!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_2_Sellsword_Normal","Strange. It feels familiar and unfamiliar at the same time."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_3_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal","Let's go inside!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_4_Sellsword_Normal","I got something."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_5_Sellsword_Normal","Some stuff, and a note…"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__1_Any_Default","Soraks!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__2_Any_Default","So they're involved, for sure!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__3_Sellsword_Default","I'll find the rest and kill them!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_1_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Clear skies! Did you go to the house?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_2_Sellsword_Normal","Yes - and I found this note!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_3_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Interesting - and surprising!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_4_Sellsword_Normal","Surprising? "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Well, why hide it? They could have shown it to the Ceannard!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_6_Sellsword_Normal","Anyway, this was written by the real spy."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","So what?"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_8_CynicOrElse_Slang","Good luck finding the writer!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_9_Sellsword_Normal","Yes, that's it! "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_10_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","What do you mean? "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_11_Sellsword_Normal","The note - the writing reveals the spy."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Then why didn't your parents use it at the trial? It would have saved their lives!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_13_Sellsword_Normal","Because they wanted to keep me safe!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Then they must have known that the spy was present at their trial!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","You know… paperwork."
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","The Ceannard, he swears by the rule of law! "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Every trial is recorded. It's all in the archives!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_18_Sellsword_Normal","So we have our list of suspects!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_19_MildredWarmhearth_NPC","Exactly!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_1_AllanMiller_NPC","Clear skies! What can I do for you today? "
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_2_Sellsword_Normal","We need to consult the archives!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_3_AllanMiller_NPC","Give me the year and the case, and I'll get whatever you need!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_4_AcademicOrElse_Normal","Is that your writing? I've never seen anything so neat!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_5_AllanMiller_NPC","It's my job. An archive needs to be clear and legible!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_6_Sellsword_Slang","Right - so your agents don't misunderstand your orders. Traitor!"
"Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_7_AllanMiller_NPC","Ah, you're too smart for you own good."
"Background_Sellsword_End_1_Ceannard_NPC","Ah - I expected you."
"Background_Sellsword_End_2_Sellsword_Default","Ceannard. "
"Background_Sellsword_End_3_Ceannard_NPC","You know the truth. I hope you can forgive me."
"Background_Sellsword_End_4_Ceannard_NPC","To think the Soraks were already here…"
"Background_Sellsword_End_5_Ceannard_NPC","…manipulating me…"
"Background_Sellsword_End_6_Sellsword_Default","It's in the past."
"Background_Sellsword_End_7_Sellsword_Default","Though I'd like you to restore my family's name."
"Background_Sellsword_End_8_Ceannard_NPC","The paperwork is under way."
"Background_Sellsword_End_9_Ceannard_NPC","Their names will be on a memorial I intend to build."
"Background_Sellsword_End_10_Sellsword_Default","Great thanks."
"Background_Sellsword_End_11_Ceannard_NPC","Clear skies, my friends."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Start1_Bagmordah_NPC","Ah, there you are! Clear skies, my friends!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Start2_Bagmordah_NPC","Someone came to see you."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Start3_Academic_Default","Me? Who?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Start4_Bagmordah_NPC","An old acquaintance, I gather. Master Dackin."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Start5_Bagmordah_NPC","He said he'd wait for you at Sunblaze Court."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Start6_Academic_Default","Oh! Thanks for the message. Stay in the light!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Start7_Anyother_Default","Everything all right?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Start8_Academic_Default","Like she said - an old acquaintance."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster1_Dackin_NPC","You came! I wondered, considering your new… rank."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster2_Academic_Default","How are you, Master?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster3_Dackin_NPC","It's nice that you pretend to care…"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster4_Academic_Default","Are you going to hate me forever?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster5_Dackin_NPC","I don't hate you. I just…"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster6_Dackin_NPC","…well, it was your right to leave and…"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster7_Dackin_NPC","…pursue a life of adventure."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster8_Dackin_NPC","Even if it wastes your academic talent."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster9_Academic_Default","It serves me well, thanks to you."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster10_Dackin_NPC","Maybe. Still, I'm without an assistant. "
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster11_Dackin_NPC","Times have been hard."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster12_Dackin_NPC","The Guild offered me a posting… south."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster13_Academic_Default","You're not getting your department chair?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster14_Dackin_NPC","Evidently not - unless I can make a major contribution."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster15_Dackin_NPC","That's why I wanted to see you."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster16_Dackin_NPC","I heard you went to Caer Lem, in the Marches."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster17_Academic_Default","That's right."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster18_Dackin_NPC","There is an old Tirmarian tower there."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster19_Academic_Default","Oh, yes. Very impressive, too."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster20_Dackin_NPC","If I could just explore it - bring something back…"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster21_Dackin_NPC","Something the Guild couldn't ignore…"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster22_Dackin_NPC","I would have a chance at this chair."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster23_Dackin_NPC","The Scavengers say it's safe now. I can go."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster24_Dackin_NPC","But once there, I'll need… well, some specific expertise."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster25_Academic_Default","…and that's us."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster26_Dackin_NPC","It could salvage my career!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster27_Academic_Default","Of course. I owe you that much, Master."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster28_Dackin_NPC","Thanks. Find me at Caer Lem, then. I'll be ready!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster29_Academic_Default","We'll see you there. Stay in the light, Master!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem1_Friendly_Default","Clear skies, friend!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem2_Bertram_NPC","Clear skies, deputy!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem3_Greed_WRITTEN","How's business in Caer Lem?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem4_Friendly_WRITTEN","What's your name?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem5_Nosy_WRITTEN","Did you find the secret passage?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","Have you seen Master Dackin?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem7_Greed_Choice","How's business been since we… cleaned up the place?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem8_Bertram_NPC","Not bad! Some folks are starting to explore a little further."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem9_Bertram_NPC","Though this… Sorak attack still has people nervous."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem10_Bertram_NPC","Still, there's been no sign of them since…"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem11_Bertram_NPC","…so we mostly pretend it didn't happen."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem12_Pragmatic_Default","Huh - good for you."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem13_Bertram_NPC","I'm Bertram."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem14_Friendly_Default","Good to meet you, Bertram."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem15_Bertram_NPC","I think so, but… your Sorak buddies seem to have blocked it."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem16_Bertram_NPC","They must have dug a little too hard in there."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem17_Greed_Default","I'm sure we can solve this little problem."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem18_Bertram_NPC","The Antiquarian? Sure."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem19_Bertram_NPC","He's in the courtyard."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem20_Bertram_NPC","He's been staring at the tower…"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem21_Bertram_NPC","…trying to figure a way to get up there."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem22_Bertram_NPC","But he can't fly… wait, can he?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem23_Academic_Default","Seems not."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster1_Dackin_NPC","There you are!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster2_Academic_Default","Are you ready for this?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster3_Dackin_NPC","I am. Any idea how to get up there?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster4_Academic_Default","One or two."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster5_Dackin_NPC","I tried to think of a way, but…"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster6_Dackin_NPC","…still, this place is incredible!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster7_Dackin_NPC","Did you notice that there was minor gate just here in the courtyard?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster8_Academic_Default","As a matter of fact, I did."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster9_Pragmatic_Default","Let's get to it, if you don't mind."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower1_Dackin_NPC","Fantastic… it looks like… well, another world."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower2_Dackin_NPC","You must have seen so much!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower3_Academic_Default","I have. But this is still…"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower4_Dackin_NPC","…fascinating."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower5_Anyother_Default","Well, I see where you got your passion for learning!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower6_Academic_Default","Let's look around."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower7_Academic_Default","Gather all the antiques we can."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary1_Dackin_NPC","By all the gods!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary2_Dackin_NPC","This is really something. "
"Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary3_Academic_Default","It explains the library we found down in the caves."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary4_Dackin_NPC","The place seems… dangerous."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary5_Academic_Default","Definitely. Be ready for a fight."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary6_Dackin_NPC","Wait - you know me. I don't fight."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight1_Academic_Default","Are you all right, Master?"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight2_Dackin_NPC","I am… alive, or so it seems."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight3_Academic_Default","Those are quite common in the Marches."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight4_Dackin_NPC","Just tell me there's something valuable down here!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight5_Academic_Default","Oh, I think you'll be happy."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending1_Dackin_NPC","This is… more than I dared hope for… so much more!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending2_Academic_Default","Good! I think the Guild will treat you a little better now. They'd lick your boots for a look at these!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending3_Dackin_NPC","I'd like to see them do that - one or two of them, in particular…"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending4_Dackin_NPC","These will be perfect! Take whatever else you want - I have plenty!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending5_Dackin_NPC","…And thank you. "
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending6_Academic_Default","You're welcome, Master."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending7_Dackin_NPC","I think it's time you stop calling me that, you know."
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending8_Academic_Default","Well, how about Chairman of the Guild, then? With these books…"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending9_Dackin_NPC","Stay in the light, my friend!"
"Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending10_Academic_Default","You, too!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start1_Merton_NPC","Hey! Interested in a little side-job?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start2_Player_Default","What kind of side-job?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start3_Merton_NPC","The kind that takes particular skills and contacts."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start4_Merton_NPC","In the - shall we say - involuntary gift business."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start5_Player_Default","Involuntary gift business'? That's just embarrassing."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start6_Player_Default","Say what you mean - the underworld, right?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start7_Merton_NPC","And there I was trying to be discreet."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start8_Lowlife_Default","Try harder. Suppose I do have the skills and contacts you're looking for?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start9_Merton_NPC","Go to Annie Bagmordah at the Scavengers."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start10_Merton_NPC","Tell her I sent you."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlifeb_Default","Merton says you got a problem."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Annie_NPC","Uh… Arwin…"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Annie_NPC","What makes you think you can help?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlifeb_Default","Not saying I can, yet. But I know people."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Annie_NPC","People who can track down stolen goods?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Lowlifeb_Default","What kind of goods?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Annie_NPC","A sword. Imperial."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Annie_NPC","The guard has three diamonds. Probably magical."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Curious_Default","Probably? What does it probably do?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Annie_NPC","Never got a chance to find out."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Greedy_Default","You offering a reward?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie11_Annie_NPC","I'll make it worth your while."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie12_Joker_Default","Are you not the one supposed to bring back stuff?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie13_Annie_NPC","Very funny."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel1_Lowlife_Default","Hey, Nel! Still laughing?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel2_Nel_NPC","Like Misaye herself! You?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel3_Lowlife_NPC","Happy as a rat in a granary. Need an ear out."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel4_Nel_NPC","For?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel5_Lowlife_Default","A nice antique sword with three diamonds."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel6_Lowlife_Default","Hear anything?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel7_Nel_NPC","Something. Talk to Gorim."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel8_Joker_Default","So that's your former life, walking the streets?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel9_Lowlife_Default","And cutting the throats of people who crossed me."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlife_Default","Hey, Gorim! I'm in the market for a sword."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Lowlife_Default","A very particular one."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Gorim_NPC","How particular?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlife_Default","Imperial, three diamonds in the guard, probably magical."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Lowlife_Default","Sound familiar?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Gorim_NPC","Too expensive for me. I turned him down."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Lowlife_Default","He have a name?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Gorim_NPC","Didn't say. I told him to ask for Surespell at the Gravekeep's Cask."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Gorim_NPC","The Arcaneum has money."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Lowlife_Default","Thanks."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie11_Gorim_NPC","Thank me by buying something."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie12_Lowlife_Default","Another time, but I will."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie13_Gorim_NPC","I'll remember!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern1_Karel_NPC","Hey, Karel!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern2_Lowlife_Default","Back again?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern3_Karel_NPC","Has anyone been in asking for Surespell?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern4_Karel_NPC","The Arcaneum guy?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern5_Karel_NPC","Yes, as it happens. Over there. Still waiting, it seems."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern6_Lowlife_Default","Thanks."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern7_Lowlife_Default","I've been looking for you."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern8_Thief_NPC","I'm waiting for someone, and you're not him. Get lost."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern9_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","You have a stolen sword."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","Let's make a deal."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern11_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","You're in trouble."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern12_Intimidator_Answer1","Don't come the hard case with me. You won't win."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern13_Intimidator_Answer2","You have a sword that doesn't belong to you."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern14_Thief_Success","Listen, I don't want any trouble… "
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern15_Thief_Failure","You deaf or something? I said, get lost!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern16_Persuader_Answer1","You're waiting for someone to buy a sword."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern17_Persuader_Answer2","Old, three diamonds, probably magical. Am I right?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern18_Thief_Success","How do you…?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern19_Thief_Success2","Doesn't matter."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern20_Thief_Success2","What matters is, do you want a Council deputy owing you a favor?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern21_Thief_Success3","It had better be a pretty big favor."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern22_Thief_Failure","I can make better friends than you with a sword like that…"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern23_Thief_Failure","…and get paid too!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern24_Deceiver_Answer1","It's about that very nice sword…"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern25_Deceiver_Answer2","…that you're thinking of selling…"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern26_Deceiver_Answer3","…to Heddlon Surespell of the Arcaneum."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern28_Deceiver_Success2","What matters is, do you want to end up nailed to a door in Fishtown?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern29_Thief_Success3","What?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern30_Deceiver_Success4","You see, the sword was already spoken for when you stole it from the Scavengers…"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern31_Deceiver_Success5","…and a certain someone's going to be very disappointed if they don't get it as planned."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern32_Deceiver_Success6","The sort of someone who nails people to doors in Fishtown."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern33_Thief_NPC","Misaye's crooked dice! I… I can get it for you."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern34_Deceiver_Success7","Just tell me where to find it. Then it might be wise to leave town."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern35_Deceiver_Success8","I hear the Southern Isles are lovely at this time of year."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern36_Thief_Failure1","Ooh! I'm so scared. Sell your drivel somewhere else."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern37_Any_Allfailed","Perhaps you missed our nice badge, here."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern38_Thief_NPC","The Council? Oh, come on…"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern39_Thief_NPC","It's in Misaye's temple for safekeeping."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern40_Thief_NPC","Ask Nel for a bowl of soup."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern41_Lowlife_Default","Nel? I just talked to him… I should have known…"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern41_Cynical_Default","Bowl of soup? That's the worst password I've ever heard!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple1_Lowlife_Default","Hey, Nel. So, I'm supposed to ask you for, uh…"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple2_Nel_NPC","A bowl of soup?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple3_Lowlife_Default","You knew? "
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple4_Nel_NPC","Of course! Misaye sees all!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple5_Lowlife_Default","And you didn't tell me because…?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple6_Nel_NPC","This was more fun!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple7_Lowlife_Default","For you and Misaye, I'm sure."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple8_Lowlife_Default","Well, I won't be a grouch about it."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple9_Nel_NPC","Aww! Misaye loves to tease a grouch!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple10_Nel_NPC","Ask properly!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple11_Lowlife_Default","Really?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple12_Nel_NPC","Rules are rules!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple13_Lowlife_Default","Rules - you? Oh, wait - only when it's fun, right?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple14_Nel_NPC","You're learning!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple15_Lowlife_Default","All right, then. chaplain Nel - may I please have a bowl of soup?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple16_Nel_NPC","Of course! It's in that chest."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple17_Lowlife_Default","This locked chest? I should have known."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple18_Lowlife_Default","Got it!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple19_Lowlife_Default","I can't get it…"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple20_Nel_NPC","Make a donation to Misaye for luck?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple21_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","<i>Give 1 gold piece</i>"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","Refuse"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_Lowlife_Default","Take it, you crook."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple23_Lowlife_Default","I don't think so."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple24_Nel_NPC","Your coin made Misaye smile!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple25_Nel_NPC","Try again, Misaye will help, this time."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple26_Lowlife_Default","Still nothing!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple27_Nel_NPC","Maybe you need to be more generous!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple28_Nel_NPC","You probably used the wrong number…"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple29_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","<i>Give 5 gold pieces</i>"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple30_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","Refuse"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple30_Nel_NPC","Fine. Let's hope your skills are up to it."
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple31_Nel_NPC","Have you trained in your skills since the last time?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple32_Nel_NPC","You're welcome. Misaye's laughing!"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceG_WRITTEN","<i>Give 200 gold pieces</i>"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceF_WRITTEN","<i>Give 100 gold pieces</i>"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceE_WRITTEN","<i>Give 50 gold pieces</i>"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceD_WRITTEN","<i>Give 20 gold pieces</i>"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","<i>Give 10 gold pieces</i>"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest90_Scavengers2_Bagmordah_NPC","You're back! Did you get it?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest91_Scavengers2_Lowlife_Default","Here! And you mentioned a reward?"
"Optional_Lowlife_Quest92_Scavengers2_Bagmordah_NPC","Beside my undying gratitude? All right. Here."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest1_Lawkeeper_Default","Hey, shorty! You in the army?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest2_Stig_NPC","Don't call me that! I'm a Royal Guard, you know."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest3_Lawkeeper_Default","You… really? The Princess, and all?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest4_Stig_NPC","Yeah. Those your friends?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest5_Friendly_Default","We are. How do you know each other?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest6_Stig_NPC","You didn't tell them?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest7_Stig_NPC","We were in the City Guard together."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest8_Lawkeeper_Default","And we both… upgraded."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest9_Stig_NPC","Anyway, I need help."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest10_Stig_NPC","I think someone's rotten in the Guard."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest11_Selfpres_Default","That's reassuring…"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest12_Pragmatic_Default","We have important things to do, mind you."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest13_Lawkeeper_Default","Hey, Stig is my friend!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest14_Pragmatic_Default","Fine."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest15_Stig_NPC","I need to go. Meet me at the Palace entrance when you… have time."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest16_Lawkeeper_Default","Hey, Stig!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest17_Stig_NPC","Hey, there. You ready?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest18_Lawkeeper_Default","Sure."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest21_Any","So, what can we do to help?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest22_Stig_NPC","I have four suspects. Here are their names and posts."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest23_Stig_NPC","It won't be easy."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest24_Stig_NPC","They mustn't know I suspect them."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest25_Lawkeeper_Default","We'll check them out - no problem!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest26_Stig_NPC","Strike true!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge27_Cynical_Default","All right. Stig says he should be leaving soon."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge28_Lawful_Default","There he goes. Let him get a head start."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge29_Lawful_Default","…let's find a spot with a good view and wait for the night."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge30_Cynical_Default","Now that's a conspiracy!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge31_Cynical_Default","There might be an angry husband."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge32_Cynical_Default","It might be worth an arrest."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge33_Lawkeeper_Default","Shut up!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance34_Friendly_Default","Clear skies!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance35_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","I know you - you're the Sorak killers!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance36_Lawkeeper_Default","Anything you want to share… off the books?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance37_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","What?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance38_Lawkeeper_Default","A little business of yours."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance39_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","Oh. Sure."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance40_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","Not here, though. Meet me at the promontory, tonight."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance41_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","Quiet place. I like it."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance42_Lawkeeper_Default","So, what have you got?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance43_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","In a rush, eh? All right. Here."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance44_Lawkeeper_Default","Booze? Really?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance45_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","Hey, you asked for it!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance46_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","My boss would kill me for selling New Empire liquor."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance47_Lawkeeper_Default","This isn't illegal?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance48_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC","Of course not! Just… you know… Imperial. Slaver stuff."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance49_Lawkeeper_Default","Never mind. Our mistake. Sorry to waste your time."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk50_Drunk_NPC","This is my seat!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk51_Drunk_NPC","I always sit here!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk52_Drunk_NPC","You're a strange bunch, you know that?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk53_Drunk_NPC","Even stranger than that Arwin Merton."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk54_Drunk_NPC","Are you gonna say something?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk55_Drunk_NPC","Knew it. You Council pawns are fake."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk56_Drunk_NPC","Killed Soraks? Right. And I've got a dragon in my pocket."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk57_Drunk_NPC","Now you're pissing me off."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk58_Lawkeeper_Default","Well, I'm not sure he's smart enough to be corrupt."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk59_Any_Default","Think he can work? He can barely stand!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk60_Any_Default","Let's go and see, then."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk61_Lawkeeper_Default","What is he doing?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk62_Partner_Default","Hijacking a crate from a delivery."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk63_Lawkeeper_Default","Let's see what's in it."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk64_Lawkeeper_Default","Flowers?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk65_Herbalism_Default","Angry Violets, hundreds of them."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk66_Drunk_NPC","Hey! What are you doing?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk67_Persuasion_WRITTEN","We just want a share of the loot."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk68_Intimidation_WRITTEN","You're clearly a thief - admit it!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk69_Deception_WRITTEN","We're investigating you for Captain Ironshell."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk70_Default_WRITTEN","The question is, what are you doing?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk71_Persuasion_CHOICE","We got you. Let us take some of these and we'll keep quiet."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk72_Drunk_FAIL","You Council people really think you can do whatever you like, don't you?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk73_Intimidation_CHOICE","We caught you red-handed. Just confess."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk74_Intimidation_FAIL","You're a bunch of idiots, I'll confess that."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk75_Deception_FAIL","Captain Ironshell asked us to investigate you."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk76_Drunk_FAIL","Oh yeah? That's a good one. She asked me to bring this to the Palace."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk77_Default_FAIL","The question is, what are you doing?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk78_Drunk_FAIL","My job. What did you think I was doing?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk79_Lawkeeper_Default","Why did you pick this crate out of the delivery?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk80_Drunk_NPC","Oh, this one? "
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk81_Drunk_NPC","Let me think. "
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk82_Drunk_NPC","This is for her Royal Highness, going through Captain Ironshell directly."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk83_Drunk_NPC","I'm sure the Princess will appreciate you rummaging through her personal stuff."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk84_Drunk_NPC","As everyone knows, everything for her personal use is tax free."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk85_Cynical_Default","I knew that."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk86_Drunk_NPC","Ask the Captain. Go right ahead."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk87_Lawkeeper_Default","That won't be necessary. Carry on."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple88_TempleGuard_NPC","Rodric isn't here."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple89_TempleGuard_NPC","Rodric? He's on an errand."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple90_Any_Default","Nothing. We're wasting our time."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple91_Lawkeeper_Default","This Rodric, though - where is he?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple92_Any_Default","Let's check again."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple93_Lawkeeper_Default","You're Rodric?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple94_Alrin_NPC","Who's asking?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple95_Lawkeeper_Default","We're Council deputies…"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End96_Any_Default","What was that?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End97_Any_Default","He's not just a Guard, that's for sure!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End98_Arcana_Default","That's a shadowcaster trick! He can't be far!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End99_Lawkeeper_Default","Look for tracks."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End100_Lawkeeper_Default","A secret tunnel? We're on to something here!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End101_Lawkeeper_Default","What have you found?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End102_Any_Default","Enough to implicate Rodric and his friends."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End103_Any_Default","They were smuggling goods in and out of the Temple Quarter."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End104_Lawkeeper_Default","Hey, Stig!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End105_Stig_NPC","I heard what happened! Rodric's a shadowcaster?"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End106_Lawkeeper_Default","Rodric's a corpse. He attacked us with a bunch of his friends."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End107_Lawkeeper_Default","Take this. You can follow up and shut down his network."
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End108_Stig_NPC","Fantastic! Thanks for the help, my friends!"
"Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End109_Lawkeeper_Default","Stay in the light, Stig!"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start1_Mayor_NPC","A moment, if you please, deputy!"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start2_Aristocrat_Default","Lady Bright-Spark? How may we help you?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start3_Mayor_NPC","You could start by not calling me that."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start4_Aristocrat_Default","As you wish."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start5_Mayor_NPC","I have a messy business on my desk, and your name's on it."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start6_Aristocrat_Default","My name?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start7_Mayor_NPC","It's an inheritance…"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start8_Mayor_NPC","…with a bunch of people contesting the will."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start9_Aristocrat_Default","What? Who died?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start10_Mayor_NPC","The honorable Joan Tannerson."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start11_Aristocrat_Default","Oh. I see."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start12_Anyother_Default","Family?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start13_Aristocrat_Default","She was… my mentor. A renowned lawyer."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start14_Cynical_Default","You're a lawyer?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start15_Aristocrat_Default","Do I look like a lawyer?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start16_Cynical_Default","Wouldn't put it past you."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start17_Aristocrat_Default","What is the mess, exactly?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start18_Mayor_NPC","Tannerson left you everything, according to the will."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start19_Mayor_NPC","Her children aren't happy, and the notary is very… annoying."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start20_Mayor_NPC","So please - do something. Anything. Just make them stop harassing me."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start21_Mayor_NPC","I have more important things to deal with."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start22_Aristocrat_Default","Perhaps I should talk to the children first."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start23_Mayor_NPC","Do whatever you want, as long as it shuts this notary up!"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start24_Aristocrat_Default","Right. Thank you… my lady."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Start25_Mayor_NPC","Tsss…"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Drew11_Aristocrat_Default","Drew! How are you holding up?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Drew12_Drew_NPC","Look - it's the famous heir. Should I bow?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Drew13_Aristocrat_Default","Listen, I have no idea…"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Drew14_Drew_NPC","Of course! It's just bad luck that you got everything."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Drew15_Aristocrat_Default","Can we talk?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Drew16_Drew_NPC","Talk to my lawyer. Oh, wait…"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Drew17_Violent_Default","He needs a smack in the mouth."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Drew18_Aristocrat_Default","He's… grieving."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Drew19_Violent_Default","I'll give him something to grieve over."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria11_Aristocrat_Default","Lyria, I'm so very sorry for your loss."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria12_Lyria_NPC","Oh - you're the… well… I knew she liked you, but…"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria13_Aristocrat_Default","Frankly, this all seems like a prank."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria14_Lyria_NPC","Right? That's what I told the notary."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria15_Lyria_NPC","Goodbye."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria16_Lowlife_Default","These people!"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria11_Aristocrat_Default","Adria! How are you?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria12_Adria_NPC","Well, sad, of course. You?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria13_Aristocrat_Default","Thanks for asking. A bit down, of course."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria14_Aristocrat_Default","She taught me so much."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria15_Adria_NPC","I know. She was proud of you."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria16_Aristocrat_Default","Thank you. "
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria17_Aristocrat_Default","Listen - this will. It bothers me…"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria18_Aristocrat_Default","…I really don't want to quarrel with you and your siblings."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria19_Adria_NPC","I'm afraid you won't have a choice."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria110_Adria_NPC","Lyria is a lying bitch, and Drew is a tactless jerk."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria111_Aristocrat_Default","What would you do with the inheritance?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria112_Adria_NPC","Me? Share it with the two other sharks, just to stay alive."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Adria113_Aristocrat_Default","Fair enough."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Attack1_Anyother_Default","They're not bandits."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Attack2_Aristocrat_Default","No. More like hired assassins."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Attack3_Anyother_Default","You know what this means."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Attack4_Aristocrat_Default","Stay alert. The notary's mansion might not be safe either."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending1_Cynical_Default","Oh, look - they're all here."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending2_Lyria_NPC","So you left Caer Cyflen without a word. "
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending3_Drew_NPC","How rude."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending4_Aristocrat_Default","Can we take this inside?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending5_Lyria_NPC","Just tell us what you decided and stop wasting our time."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending6_Lyria_NPC","At least share the inheritance. I need it for my research."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending7_Lyria_Default","The Circle of Danantar will reward you."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending8_Drew_NPC","Yeah, right. That inheritance will give me enough to get married…"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending9_Drew_Default","My father-in-law to be is very influential in the Tower of Knowledge, you know."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending10_Aristocrat_Default","Adria?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending11_Adria_NPC","I respect Mother's decision. It's all yours."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending12_Drew_NPC","What? Did the Soraks replace you or something?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending13_Lyria_NPC","Even from you, Drew, that's low."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending14_Notary_NPC","Ah, so you are all here."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending15_Notary_NPC","Why didn't you come in?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending16_Aristocrat_Default","You're right. Let's finish this."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending17_WRITTEN_ChoiceA","The inheritance is mine."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending18_WRITTEN_ChoiceB","<i>Choose an heir from among the children.</i>"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending19_WRITTEN_ChoiceC","<i>Split the inheritance four ways.</i>"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending20_WRITTEN_ChoiceD","<i>Split the inheritance between the children.</i>"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending21_Aristocrat_ChoiceA","Your mother left me everything. Her will should be respected."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending22_Aristocrat_ChoiceC","We'll split the inheritance between the four of us."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending23_Aristocrat_ChoiceD","You should each get a third of the inheritance."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending24_WRITTEN_ChoiceE","<i>Give the inheritance to Lyria.</i>"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending25_WRITTEN_ChoiceF","<i>Give the inheritance to Drew.</i>"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending26_WRITTEN_ChoiceG","<i>Give the inheritance to Adria.</i>"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending27_Aristocrat_ChoiceE","I'll give Lyria the inheritance."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending28_Aristocrat_ChoiceF","I'll give Drew the inheritance."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending29_Aristocrat_ChoiceG","I'll give Adria the inheritance."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending30_Lyria_NPC","Excellent!"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending31_Drew_NPC","By all the gods…"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending32_Drew_NPC","Yes!"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending33_Lyria_NPC","What? Why?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending34_Adria_NPC","Thank you! I'll share with you both, you know it."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending35_Notary_NPC","Well, that's settled, then."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending36_Notary_NPC","I will magically seal the will."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending37_Notary_NPC","I'm sorry, the law forbids it."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending38_Notary_NPC","You can share it after you accept it, but there must be one single heir."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending39_Notary_NPC","You know… paperwork."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending40_Adria_NPC","Fine… I thought I had cracked you…"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending41_Aristocrat_Default","What?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending42_Adria_Default","Sorry, sir, this will have to be done outside the law, I'm afraid."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending43_Anyother_Default","She killed all her siblings?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending44_Cynical_Default","Maybe she was a Sorak agent?"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending45_Aristocrat_Default","They were all my childhood friends…"
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending46_Cynical_Default","Oh, yes. Sorry."
"Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending47_Aristocrat_Default","It's over. Let's go."
"NecromancyQuest01_01_Default_Default","Who's this? Seems to like wolves."
"NecromancyQuest01_02_Insight_10_Success","Could be a ranger. Could be a werewolf. Could be something else."
"NecromancyQuest01_03_Kill-CHOICE","Let's kill them!"
"NecromancyQuest01_04_Leave_CHOICE","Let's get out of here!"
"NecromancyQuest01_05_Speak_CHOICE","Let's talk to him."
"NecromancyQuest01_06_Kill_Default","Just someone else to kill. No one out here is friendly, remember?"
"NecromancyQuest01_07_Friendly_Default","Maybe he knows something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask."
"NecromancyQuest01_08_Pragmatic_Default","Out here, there's no such thing as ""can't hurt."" "
"NecromancyQuest01_09_Pragmatic_Default","Didn't your mother tell you never to talk to strangers?"
"NecromancyQuest01_10_Leave_Default","We're not here to make friends, and we have enough enemies. Let's just go!"
"NecromancyQuest01_11_Speak_Default","He might know something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask."
"NecromancyQuest01_12_Persuade_CHOICE","Hello!"
"NecromancyQuest01_13_Intimidate_CHOICE","Get over here!"
"NecromancyQuest01_14_Friendly_Default","Hello! We come in peace! Can we talk to you?"
"NecromancyQuest01_15_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success","Talk, then. And stay where you are. I can hear you well enough from here."
"NecromancyQuest01_16_Persuade_Default_20_Success","We're… interested in the castle. Can you tell us anything about it?"
"NecromancyQuest01_17_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success","Not much. What do you want to know?"
"NecromancyQuest01_18_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure","You come in peace, do you? Then you're the only peaceful things here."
"NecromancyQuest01_19_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure","Go in peace, before I get tired of being peaceful."
"NecromancyQuest01_20_Intimidate_Default","Hey, you! Get over here!"
"NecromancyQuest01_21_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success","I can hear you fine from here. What do you want?"
"NecromancyQuest01_22_Intimidate_Default_20_Success","What do you know about that castle over there?"
"NecromancyQuest01_23_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success","What do you want to know?"
"NecromancyQuest01_24_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure","Ha! Aren't you tough?"
"NecromancyQuest01_25_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure","Believe me, you don't want me coming over there."
"NecromancyQuest01_26_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure","Now get lost, before I change my mind!"
"NecromancyQuest01_27_Default_CHOICE","Who lives there?"
"NecromancyQuest01_28_Fighter_CHOICE","How strong is the garrison?"
"NecromancyQuest01_29_Authority_CHOICE","Who is its ruler?"
"NecromancyQuest01_30_Default_Default","Who lives there? What can you tell us about them?"
"NecromancyQuest01_31_Talbut_NPC","I deal with the guard captain. Name's Adam the Twelfth. Undead now."
"NecromancyQuest01_32_Talbut_NPC","He lets us hunt here and we tell him who comes and goes."
"NecromancyQuest01_33_Default_Default","Sounds like a good arrangement. So you've never been inside the castle?"
"NecromancyQuest01_34_Talbut_NPC","No."
"NecromancyQuest01_35_Default_Default","And there's no one else outside the castle?"
"NecromancyQuest01_36_Default_Default","Just a ghost - a dwarf. Doesn't seem dangerous."
"NecromancyQuest01_37_Fighter_Default","What's the garrison like? Strong? Weak? Monsters?"
"NecromancyQuest01_38_Talbut_NPC","The captain's a wraith, or something similar. The guard's mostly skeletons."
"NecromancyQuest01_39_Fighter_Default","Mostly?"
"NecromancyQuest01_40_Talbut_NPC","That's what I've seen from outside. Never been inside."
"NecromancyQuest01_41_Authority_Default","Who rules the castle? Or should I rather ask what?"
"NecromancyQuest01_42_Talbut_NPC","Name's Mardracht. Probably undead, but I never met him."
"NecromancyQuest01_43_Authority_Default","Probably undead? Why do you say that?"
"NecromancyQuest01_44_Talbut_NPC","Undead or a necromancer, is my guess. Everyone I've seen there is undead."
"NecromancyQuest01_45_WRITTEN_Exit","Thanks, that's all."
"NecromancyQuest01_45_Goodbye_Default","Many thanks for the information, uh - I didn't catch your name?"
"NecromancyQuest01_46_Talbut_NPC","Talbut."
"NecromancyQuest02_01_Starter_Normal","Look! What's that?"
"NecromancyQuest02_02_Partner_Normal","Some kind of incorporeal being - undead, most likely."
"NecromancyQuest02_03_Starter_Normal","Look! That must be the dwarf ghost we heard about!"
"NecromancyQuest02_04_Kill-CHOICE","Let's destroy it!"
"NecromancyQuest02_05_Leave_CHOICE","Let's keep moving."
"NecromancyQuest02_06_Speak_CHOICE","Let's talk to him."
"NecromancyQuest02_07_Kill_Default","The undead are an affront to nature! They must be destroyed!"
"NecromancyQuest02_08_Leave_Default","An unnecessary fight is an unnecessary risk. Let's move on."
"NecromancyQuest02_09_Speak_Default","I'll take information where I can get it - even from a ghost."
"NecromancyQuest02_10_Persuade_CHOICE","We have questions."
"NecromancyQuest02_11_Intimidate_CHOICE","Get over here!"
"NecromancyQuest02_12_Starter_Normal","Hello! Could we ask you some questions?"
"NecromancyQuest02_13_Starter_Normal","Hello! Are you the Antiquarian we've heard about?"
"NecromancyQuest02_14_Angbi_NPC","Hello! I am Angbi Kramsson, of the Guild of Antiquarians. Or at least, I used to be."
"NecromancyQuest02_15_Intimidate","Hey, you - ghost! Get over here!"
"NecromancyQuest02_15_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success","All right. There's no need to be rude. What do you want?"
"NecromancyQuest02_16_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure","What are you going to do - kill me? Just - leave me alone."
"NecromancyQuest02_17_Starter_Default","What can you tell us about the castle? Who lives there?"
"NecromancyQuest02_18_Angbi_NPC","Two women. A high elf, but living, and quite old. She is a necromancer of some sort."
"NecromancyQuest02_19_Starter_Default","And the other?"
"NecromancyQuest02_20_Angbi_NPC","Once human, but definitely undead now. A Defiler, I think…"
"NecromancyQuest02_21_Angbi_NPC","…and she had a gang of ghouls with her. Horrid beasts. I avoided them."
"NecromancyQuest02_22_Starter_Default","Is there anyone else?"
"NecromancyQuest02_23_Angbi_NPC","There's a garrison - skeletons, mostly. I avoided them, too."
"NecromancySubQuest101_01_NPC_Angbi","Actually, I was hoping to ask you a greater favor."
"NecromancySubQuest101_02_Starter_Default","How can we help you?"
"NecromancySubQuest101_03_NPC_Angbi","I was killed in this cemetery. My bones are here somewhere."
"NecromancySubQuest101_04_Partner_Default","And you'd like us to take them home for burial, so you can find peace."
"NecromancySubQuest101_05_NPC_Angbi","Well, yes - but they got a little scattered. The wolves, you see."
"NecromancySubQuest101_06_Joker_Normal","Now, that's just rude. "
"NecromancySubQuest101_07_NPC_Angbi","As far as I can… feel, they are in three separate places."
"NecromancySubQuest101_08_Joker_Normal","Well, that's just you all over!"
"NecromancySubQuest101_09_Helpful_Normal","You can rely on us."
"NecromancySubQuest101_10_NPC_Angbi","It's not just about burial, although of course I'd be grateful for that, too."
"NecromancySubQuest101_11_NPC_Angbi","Since I was killed, I've carried on studying this necropolis…"
"NecromancySubQuest101_12_NPC_Angbi","…but I can't touch material things, including pens - so I haven't been able to update my journal."
"NecromancySubQuest101_13_Joker_Normal","Now, that's what I call work ethic."
"NecromancySubQuest101_14_NPC_Angbi","And since my spirit is bound to my mortal remains…"
"NecromancySubQuest101_15_NPC_Angbi","…I can't return to Caer Cyflen to report in person."
"NecromancySubQuest101_16_NPC_Angbi","But if you take my bones back, perhaps my spirit could travel with them…"
"NecromancySubQuest101_17_NPC_Angbi","…and the knowledge I've recovered won't be lost."
"NecromancySubQuest101_18_Helpful_Formal","We will do as you ask, Angbi Kramsson of the Antiquarians!"
"NecromancySubQuest102_01_Starter_Default","Delegate Summer! May we speak with you?"
"NecromancySubQuest102_02_NPC_Halman","Yes - what is it?"
"NecromancySubQuest102_03_Starter_Default","We have something for you. "
"NecromancySubQuest102_04_NPC_Angbi","Or rather, someONE."
"NecromancySubQuest102_05_NPC_Halman","Angbi? Angbi Kramsson? Is that you?"
"NecromancySubQuest102_06_NPC_Angbi","It is. Or was. Anyway, I'm here."
"NecromancySubQuest102_07_NPC_Angbi","These kind deputies brought my bones back, and my spirit came with them."
"NecromancySubQuest102_08_NPC_Halman","Thank you, deputies. I am in your debt, and so is the Guild of Antiquarians. "
"NecromancySubQuest102_09_NPC_Halman","On behalf of the Guild, let me offer you something for your trouble."
"NecromancySubQuest102_10_NPC_Halman","I will make sure you go home to your family for burial, Angbi."
"NecromancySubQuest102_11_NPC_Angbi","Thank you, Halman. But before you do, I'd like to make my report."
"NecromancySubQuest102_12_NPC_Halman","Your report?"
"NecromancySubQuest102_13_NPC_Angbi","One advantage of being a ghost is the ability to walk through walls, you see…"
"NecromancySubQuest102_14_NPC_Angbi","…so after my death, I was able to conduct a very thorough survey of an Imperial necropolis."
"NecromancySubQuest102_15_NPC_Angbi","I couldn't lift a pen to write it down, so I'll report in person. If that's acceptable."
"NecromancySubQuest102_16_NPC_Halman","Well… I… let me take you to the Chancellor. She will want to know."
"NecromancySubQuest102_17_NPC_Angbi","Capital! We're distant cousins, you know."
"NecromancySubQuest102_18_NPC_Halman","No, I didn't."
"NecromancyQuest03_01_Caerellian_NPC","You there! Stop! Don't move!"
"NecromancyQuest03_02_Caerellian_NPC","Who are you?"
"NecromancyQuest03_03_LEAVE_CHOICE","We should leave."
"NecromancyQuest03_04_KILL_CHOICE","We should attack."
"NecromancyQuest03_05_PERSUADE_CHOICE","We should negotiate."
"NecromancyQuest03_06_DECEIVE_CHOICE","We should trick him."
"NecromancyQuest03_07_Leave_Default","He's not the listening type, I can tell. We should leave and try another approach."
"NecromancyQuest03_08_Kill_Default","It's just a few skeletons. Let's get 'em!"
"NecromancyQuest03_09_Deceive_Default","Look, I can tell you're a very important and, ah…"
"NecromancyQuest03_10_Persuade_Default","Will you at least hear us before we go?"
"NecromancyQuest03_11_Deceiver_Normal","…long-serving officer, so I won't waste your time…"
"NecromancyQuest03_12_Deceiver_Normal","…the fact is, I'm with the Imperial intelligence service. "
"NecromancyQuest03_13_Deceiver_Normal","The others don't know, but our mission has been ordered by the Emperor himself."
"NecromancyQuest03_14_Deceiver_Normal","Our orders are to meet with your master and ask him certain questions. Nothing more than that."
"NecromancyQuest03_15_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Success","It's not up to me. You'll have to deal with the others in the keep."
"NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure","I may be dead, but I'm not stupid."
"NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure2","The Empire fell a thousand years ago. There is no Emperor."
"NecromancyQuest03_17_Caerellian_NPC","Take your lies and get out!"
"NecromancyQuest03_18_Persuader_Normal","We understand that your master values his privacy, and we respect that."
"NecromancyQuest03_19_Starter_Normal","You may not have heard of the Legacy Council, but…"
"NecromancyQuest03_20_Caerellian_NPC","I know the name. That dwarf - Antiquarian, or whatever he calls himself - they sent him too."
"NecromancyQuest03_21_Caerellian_NPC","I'll tell you what I told him: your Council has no authority here, and the master does not receive visitors!"
"NecromancyQuest03_22_Caerellian_NPC","I don't know how you got in, but either you leave peacefully, or…"
"NecromancyQuest03_23_Persuader_Normal","We know that your master is very learned and powerful. We just want to ask him about something, that's all."
"NecromancyQuest03_25_Caerellian_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure","You want to steal from him, more like!"
"NecromancyQuest03_26_Persuader_Normal","No - I swear…"
"NecromancyQuest04_01_Lizzaria_NPC","Who are you? What do you want?"
"NecromancyQuest04_02_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE","Ask for mercy."
"NecromancyQuest03_03_KILL_CHOICE","To destroy you."
"NecromancyQuest03_04_PERSUADE_CHOICE","To meet your master."
"NecromancyQuest03_05_DECEIVE_CHOICE","To make a deal."
"NecromancyQuest04_06_Intimidate_Default","Give me one good reason why we shouldn't kill you right here."
"NecromancyQuest04_07_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success","Tell me what you want, and I'll think about it."
"NecromancyQuest04_08_Intimidator_Normal","What we want?"
"NecromancyQuest04_09_Lizzaria_NPC","I know this place. You don't. Let's trade."
"NecromancyQuest04_10_Intimidator_Normal","All right - talk."
"NecromancyQuest04_11_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure","Who do you think you're dealing with? "
"NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC","That tough act may impress the girls back home…"
"NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC2","…but I've seen scarier things in the mirror."
"NecromancyQuest04_18_Kill_Default","You can never trust a necromancer. We should just kill them all."
"NecromancyQuest04_19_Persuader_Normal","We need to consult your master about an ancient magical artifact."
"NecromancyQuest04_20_Persuader_Normal","All we need is to talk to him, and then we'll be on our way and you'll never see us again."
"NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success","I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help."
"NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2","There are some things you should know."
"NecromancyQuest04_22_Persuader_Normal","What things?"
"NecromancyQuest04_23_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Falure","You must think I'm a complete idiot."
"NecromancyQuest04_24_Lizzaria_NPC","Kill them all!"
"NecromancyQuest04_25_Deceiver_Normal","Look, whatever you do in the privacy of your own castle is your own business…"
"NecromancyQuest04_26_Deceiver_Normal","…as long as you don't do it to us, of course."
"NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal","But the thing is, we've come a very long way…"
"NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal2","…and it's vitally important that we speak to Master Mardracht."
"NecromancyQuest04_28_Lizzaria_NPC","Really?"
"NecromancyQuest04_29_Deceiver_Normal","Oh, yes - it's a matter of life and - well, you know what I mean."
"NecromancyQuest04_30_Lizzaria_NPC","What's it about?"
"NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal","Ah - I'm sorry. Really. But our orders are to speak only to him."
"NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal2","They come from the very highest level."
"NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC","I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help."
"NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC2","There are some things you should know."
"NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC","Well, in that case, go straight upstairs and ask for Aksha."
"NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC2","If anyone can persuade the master, she can."
"NecromancyQuest04_35_Lizzaria_NPC","If you want to talk to Mardracht, you'll have to get past Aksha. "
"NecromancyQuest04_36_Starter_Normal","Who's Aksha?"
"NecromancyQuest04_37_Lizzaria_NPC","A defiler. She lives upstairs. "
"NecromancyQuest04_38_Lizzaria_NPC","She turned up a few years ago, seemed interested in the work, offered to help out…"
"NecromancyQuest04_39_Lizzaria_NPC","…and suddenly she'd installed herself upstairs and no one talked to the master except through her. "
"NecromancyQuest04_40_Lizzaria_NPC","I haven't seen Mardracht face to face since she got here. "
"NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC","She says she takes messages to him, and she brings messages back…"
"NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC2","…but they don't sound like him."
"NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC","I know - knew him."
"NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC2","He was my mentor, my teacher."
"NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC3","She's holding him prisoner, I'm certain."
"NecromancyQuest04_43_Starter_Normal","So we'll have to go through her? "
"NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC","If you can. She's got a pack of ghouls…"
"NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC2","…and those defiler powers of hers are no joke, either."
"NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC","We've tried using force before, more than once…"
"NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC2","…but I got sick of losing people. "
"NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal","Thanks for the warning."
"NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal2","Now, suppose we do manage to reach Master Mardracht…"
"NecromancyQuest04_47_Starter_Normal","…what's the best way to approach him? "
"NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC","Hard to say."
"NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC2","The Cataclysm hit him hard…"
"NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC3","…and then Aksha - who knows what she's done to him? "
"NecromancyQuest04_49_Lizzaria_NPC","The stairs will take you to her apartments. Good luck getting past her. "
"NecromancyQuest05_01_Aksha_NPC","Well. Lizzaria's taste in minions seems to be improving."
"NecromancyQuest05_02_Starter","We're no one's minions, lady."
"NecromancyQuest05_03_Aksha_NPC","You defeated her, then? I'm almost impressed."
"NecromancyQuest05_04_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE","Step away!"
"NecromancyQuest05_05_KILL_CHOICE","We'll destroy you!"
"NecromancyQuest05_06_PERSUADE_CHOICE","We just want to talk to Mardracht."
"NecromancyQuest05_07_DECEIVE_CHOICE","We can offer you blood."
"NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate_Defult","We need to speak to your master."
"NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate2_Defult","You can get out of our way or try to stop us."
"NecromancyQuest05_09_Deceive_Default","Let's trade. If you help us, we can help you."
"NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default","We ask a simple boon:"
"NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default2","An audience with Master Mardracht, and safe passage out of the castle."
"NecromancyQuest05_11_Kill_Default","We'll leave an impression on you, too - a deep and bloody one!"
"NecromancyQuest05_12_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success","I'm in a generous mood today. Go ahead - but don't expect to get any sense out of the old coward."
"NecromancyQuest05_13_Default_Default","What does that mean - getting sense out of him?"
"NecromancyQuest05_14_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure","Kill them! Kill them all!"
"NecromancyQuest05_15_Aksha_NPC","Trade? What do you have that I could possibly want?"
"NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal","(low voice) How about blood?"
"NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal2","Not mine, of course…"
"NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal3","…but get me in to see Mardracht and the others are all yours."
"NecromancyQuest05_17_Aksha_NPC","You'd sell the lives of your companions to see one crazy old wizard?"
"NecromancyQuest05_18_Deceiver_Normal","Crazy? What do you mean?"
"NecromancyQuest05_19_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure","You must think I was born yesterday…"
"NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal","We believe your master knows about a powerful ancient artifact."
"NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal2","We need his knowledge."
"NecromancyQuest05_21_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success","Hm. Your puny minds couldn't comprehend what he once knew."
"NecromancyQuest05_22_Aksha_NPC","Now, it's a good day if he knows who I am."
"NecromancyQuest05_23_Persuader_Normal","What do you mean?"
"NecromancyQuest05_24_Aksha_NPC","You'll see."
"NecromancyQuest05_25_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure","Let me think…"
"NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC","He's sealed his apartments off with powerful magic."
"NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC2","Keeps raving about gods coming to get him."
"NecromancyQuest05_27_Aksha_NPC","The Minor Gate is the only way in."
"NecromancyQuest05_28_Default_Default","Minor Gate?"
"NecromancyQuest05_29_Aksha_NPC","Yes. Over there."
"NecromancyQuest06_01_Mardracht_NPC","Who are you? How did you get in here?"
"NecromancyQuest06_02_Default_Default","Master Mardracht?"
"NecromancyQuest06_03_Mardracht_NPC","You know my name! How do you know my name?"
"NecromancyQuest06_04_Default_Default","We represent the Legacy Council, Master - and we mean you no harm."
"NecromancyQuest06_05_Mardracht_NPC","No harm? No harm, they say - they always say that, always. They lie!"
"NecromancyQuest06_06_Mardracht_NPC","Get out! I can still defend myself, you know!"
"NecromancyQuest06_07_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE","Can't you see we're too strong?"
"NecromancyQuest06_08_PERSUADE_CHOICE","We don't want to kill you."
"NecromancyQuest06_09_DECEIVE_CHOICE","We want to save Solasta."
"NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default","We found you and we breached your defenses."
"NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default2","Do you really want to test your power against ours?"
"NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default","You are right to fear us, and those who sent us."
"NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default2","We are powerful - but you don't have to die."
"NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default","All we ask is that you hear what we have to say."
"NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default2","After that, we'll leave you in peace if that's what you want."
"NecromancyQuest06_13_Mardracht_NP","If you are not here to kill me - then what?"
"NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal","I offer you the chance to buy your life."
"NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal2","Will you take it? Will you give up your gem?"
"NecromancyQuest06_15_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Success","For my life? I… "
"NecromancyQuest06_16_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Failure","Lies! All lies! I know your gods and their treachery!"
"NecromancyQuest06_17_Deceive_Default","The gods have commanded us to kill you…"
"NecromancyQuest06_18_Mardracht_NPC","I knew it!"
"NecromancyQuest06_19_Deceiver_Normal","…but we don't need to do that - if you'll help us."
"NecromancyQuest06_20_Deceiver_Normal","We must have the Gem of Necromancy."
"NecromancyQuest06_21_Mardracht_NPC","The gem… ? But…"
"NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal","But without your gem, we can't remake the Crown."
"NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal2","Without the Crown, we can't defeat the gods."
"NecromancyQuest06_23_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Success","I… The gods? I don't… the Crown?"
"NecromancyQuest06_24_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Failure","You have the Crown? No!"
"NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC","I see through your lies! Your evil gods want its power to destroy me!"
"NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC2","To destroy Solasta!"
"NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default","We are here to ask about the Crown of the Magister…"
"NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default2","…specifically, about the Gem of Necromancy."
"NecromancyQuest06_27_Mardracht_NPC","What? What do you know of the Crown? What are you plotting?"
"NecromancyQuest06_28_Persuader_Normal","We're not plotting anything. We don't really know what's going on."
"NecromancyQuest06_29_Persuader_Normal","But the Crown found us, and it seems that it wants to be whole again."
"NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success","But wait - the Crown is active?"
"NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2","And it chose you?"
"NecromancyQuest06_31_Persuader_Normal","Well… Yes. We're not sure why."
"NecromancyQuest06_32_Mardracht_NPC","The very existence of Solasta must be threatened!"
"NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure","Give me the Crown!"
"NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure2","This is no task for the likes of you!"
"NecromancyQuest06_34_Mardracht_NPC","I must find the other Masters! Give me the Crown!"
"NecromancyQuest06_35_Persuader_Normal","But…?"
"NecromancyQuest06_36_Mardracht_NPC","NOW!"
"NecromancyQuest06_37_Mardracht_NPC","This is what you came for."
"NecromancyQuest06_38_Mardracht_NPC","Take it - and leave me alone!"
"Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle1_Any_Default","The gem's in the castle?"
"Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle2_Any_Default","Maybe. It's in that direction."
"Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle3_Any_Default","That's a good-sized castle. A garrison of two dozen at least."
"Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle4_Any_Default","There's a path to the right. Maybe we can find cover, and size the place up without being seen."
"Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle5_Any_Default","We could just show our Legacy Council credentials."
"Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle6_Any_Default","Assuming they're law-abiding folk who'll respect the Council… "
"Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle7_Any_Default","…Not too many of those around here, I'm guessing."
"Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate1_Any_Default","We're not getting in that way."
"Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate2_Any_Default","Could we climb up?"
"Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate3_Any_Default","It's too open. We'd be easy targets."
"Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate4_Any_Default","We'll have to find another way."
"Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs1_Any_Default","Remember the way we've come. I wouldn't want to get lost down here."
"Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs2_Any_Default","Typical First Expansion architecture, with some embellishments…"
"Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs3_Any_Default","…probably used right up to the Cataclysm."
"Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs4_Any_Default","Great idea! Let's walk through the catacombs, talking loudly!"
"Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs5_Any_Default","Everyone knows the undead are deaf!"
"Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry1_Any_Default","Another door."
"Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry2_Any_Default","Oh, good. Just when I was thinking it would be too easy."
"Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry3_Any_Default","Look at the top. What is that?"
"Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry4_Any_Default","Looks like a magical shield of some sort."
"Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry5_Any_Default","Some sort? How many sorts are there?"
"Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry6_Any_Default","What we're looking for is up there."
"Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry7_Any_Default","You're sure?"
"Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry8_Any_Default","It's obvious - the best loot gets the best protection."
"Necromancy_Observable_05_Well1_Any_Default","This could be our way in."
"Necromancy_Observable_05_Well2_Any_Default","Perfect. We climb down a wet, slippery, stone shaft…"
"Necromancy_Observable_05_Well3_Any_Default","…into water that's who knows how deep…"
"Necromancy_Observable_05_Well4_Any_Default","…and hope there's a way out. What could possibly go wrong?"
"Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain1_Any_Default","This drain could be a way in."
"Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain2_Any_Default","Into what? The bathroom's one way, and the cesspool the other?"
"Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain3_Any_Default","Suppose we get down there and it's just six-inch pipes?"
"Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain4_Any_Default","Then we'll look for another way in. But let's try it first!"
"Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside1_Any_Default","That doesn't look right."
"Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside2_Any_Default","It's a drain. What's wrong with that?"
"Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside3_Any_Default","Yes, but inside a building?"
"Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside4_Any_Default","Maybe the roof leaks."
"Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside5_Any_Default","Maybe this was a stock shed. A drain can be handy for mucking out."
"Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside6_Any_Default","That one's big enough for a cow to fall down. Doesn't make sense."
"Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside7_Any_Default","Unless…"
"Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside8_Any_Default","I swear, if you say something smart…"
"Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside9_Any_Default","I never say anything that's not. But think about it:"
"Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside10_Any_Default","It's big enough to climb down. It's hidden in a building. And it's close to both the walls and the keep."
"Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside11_Any_Default","Are you saying it's a secret entrance?"
"Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs1_Any_Default","The outside graves were likely for servants and guards."
"Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs2_Any_Default","The mausoleum holds a few burials, but its main purpose is to hide this secret entrance."
"Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs3_Any_Default","The most important graves are in the catacombs down below."
"Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs4_Any_Default","And by ""important,"" you mean ""rich."""
"Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter1_Any_Default","So - this is a Minor Gate?"
"Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter2_Any_Default","And we're sure it goes where the defiler woman said it goes?"
"Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter3_Any_Default","Did you see any other way to get there?"
"Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter4_Any_Default","So we're just going to trust her?"
"Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter5_Any_Default","That looks like a Minor Gate."
"Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter6_Any_Default","Where do you suppose it goes?"
"Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter7_Any_Default","To the Master's floor, hopefully."
"Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter8_Any_Default","Or into the heart of a volcano or somewhere equally unpleasant."
"Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter9_Any_Default","We've heard how paranoid this Master is."
"Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter10_Any_Default","So - are we going?"
"Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter11_Any_Default","Why don't you go first? If it's somewhere nice, you can come back and tell us."
"Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd1_Any_Default","So that's it?"
"Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd2_Any_Default","Yes? I can feel its power. It's… incredible!"
"Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd3_Any_Default","Don't let it overwhelm you. Necromancy is dark magic."
"Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd4_Any_Default","That's right. We should probably sell it. How much do you think a smallish palace costs these days?"
"Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd5_Any_Default","Stop it. You know we can't do that."
"Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd6_Any_Default","We must get it back to the Council."
"Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd7_Any_Default","Can't blame me for trying."
"Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar1_Any_Default","Ugh. Teleporting feels weird."
"Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar2_Any_Default","I wonder what this Mardracht is like?"
"Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar3_Any_Default","If he fought at the Rift, imagine the stories he has to tell!"
"Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar4_Any_Default","Dropping in unannounced on a paranoid recluse with untold magical powers. What could possibly go wrong?"
"Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones011_Any_Default","It's a book!"
"Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones012_Any_Default","You're amazing! Just one look, and you knew!"
"Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones013_Any_Default","That's the sigil of the Antiquarians on the cover!"
"Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones014_Any_Default","It's in the common tongue: ""The Journal of Angbi Kramsson."""
"Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones015_Any_Default","Those must be his bones here."
"Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones016_Any_Default","I bet the Antiquarians would like to have this."
"Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones017_Any_Default","That was the ghost we met earlier! "
"Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText011_Any_Default","What's this?"
"Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText012_Any_Default","Going out on a limb, here - but I *think* it's a piece of parchment."
"Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText013_Any_Default","You're not as funny as you think you are."
"Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText014_Any_Default","It's high elven. Looks like notes for some kind of experiment."
"Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText015_Any_Default","Like, for example, doing unspeakable magical things to dead bodies?"
"Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText021_Any_Default","What's this? "
"Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText022_Any_Default","It's a journal. Look - dates here, and entries there."
"Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText023_Any_Default","What language is this?"
"Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText024_Any_Default","Draconic. They say it's older than high elven."
"Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText025_Any_Default","Hm. Some scholars use obscure languages to prevent others stealing their research."
"Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText026_Any_Default","Well, everyone said he was paranoid."
"Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText027_Any_Default","Or… "
"Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText028_Any_Default","What? He's a dragon? How would that work?"
"Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText029_Any_Default","The most powerful dragons can take any form they choose. Why not an elf?"
"Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText0210_Any_Default","That's pretty far-fetched. He probably just learned draconic."
"Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil1_Any_Default","That looks weird."
"Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil2_Any_Default","It's similar to some magical wards I've seen, but…"
"Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil3_Any_Default","Don't touch it! Don't go near it! Don't even look at it!"
"Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil4_Any_Default","It hasn't done anything yet."
"Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil5_Any_Default","It doesn't work? I wonder…"
"Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil6_Any_Default","Don't. Just don't."
"Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil7_Any_Default","Perhaps he made a *spelling* mistake!"
"Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil8_Any_Default","I hate you."

"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_25_Kythaela_NPC","The shield is the master, and the master is the shield! "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_26_Kythaela_NPC","But tell me - what happened? "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_27_Any_Default","A thousand years ago, the Cataclysm ravaged the Empire."

"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_41_AcademicOrElse_Default","Fascinating! You witnessed a council of war! Can you recall anything else?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_42_Kythaela_NPC","One of the beings was wearing THIS Crown, scintillating with gems. "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_43_Kythaela_NPC","They called him Magister, with the utmost respect! "

"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_54_SellswordOrElse_Slang","Just look outside, lady! The Badlands are real! "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_55_SellswordOrElse_Slang","And we had to fight Soraks to get the Crown!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_56_Kythaela_NPC","Soraks?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_57_Any_Default","The scourge of humanity."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_58_Any_Default","They ran the humans out of Tirmar…"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_59_Any_Default","…and came here to finish the job!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_60_Kythaela_NPC","The humans weren't the enemy? "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_61_Choice1_WRITTEN","They were refugees!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_62_Choice1_Spoken","No! They were refugees, fleeing the Soraks!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_63_Kythaela_NPC","Refugees? Eager to join the enlightenment of the Empire!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_64_AcademicOrElse_Default","Slavery isn't enlightenment! Those days died with the Empire!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_65_Kythaela_NPC","Silence, wretch! The Empire can't be dead!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_66_Any_NonHighElf_Rude","The Empire died with the Cataclysm! And even if it galls me to admit it…"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_67_AcademicOrElse_Default","…it saved Solasta from a horrible fate!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_68_Choice2_WRITTEN","They warned the Empire."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_69_Choice2_Spoken","They convinced the Empire of the real threat."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_70_Kythaela_NPC","Those Soraks you mentioned?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_71_AcademicOrElse_Default","Yes! Dangerous, evil lizards, able to wield magic and to subvert minds!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_72_Kythaela_NPC","Weak human minds, for sure! And yet…"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_73_AcademicOrElse_Default","And yet?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_74_Kythaela_NPC","Yet I recall an elf, a member of the household, trying to kill the Master…"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_75_Choice3_WRITTEN","They joined forces."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_76_Choice3_Spoken","Their combined forces assaulted the Rift. "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_77_Kythaela_NPC","There was mention of the Rift in the Aer-Elai."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_78_Any_Default","They managed to close it - but triggered the Cataclysm, ushering in a dark age!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_79_Kythaela_NPC","The dark age? Those Badlands you mentioned?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_80_Any_NPC","Yes! A thousand years of rebuilding after near extinction!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_81_Kythaela_NPC","It can't be! I still feel the Master!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_82_Kythaela_NPC","And I must find him!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_83_Any_Default","Times have changed since you last traveled in the Empire…"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_84_Kythaela_NPC","Still, I feel the pull! "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_85_Any_Default","The pull?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_86_Kythaela_NPC","Yes, a pull to get to the Copper Vale of Remembrance! "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_87_Kythaela_NPC","Take me there at once and I shall name you favored servants!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_88_Crownbearer_Default","The Copper Vale of Remembrance? "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_89_Kythaela_NPC","Yes - a fortress and place of rest for fallen heroes, roughly in this direction!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_90_Choice1_WRITTEN","The Vale of Coparann?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_91_Choice1_Spoken","Copper, fortress… hmmm - sounds like the Vale of Coparann!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_92_Choice2_WRITTEN","We're not your servants."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_93_Choice2_Spoken","We are no one's servants, favored or otherwise!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_94_Kythaela_NPC","Traveling companions, then!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_95_Kythaela_NPC","You can tell me of this Cataclysm on our journey!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_96_Choice3_WRITTEN","You seem sure we'll agree."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_97_Choice3_Spoken","You seem very certain that we'll go with you."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_98_Kythaela_NPC","Of course - you wouldn't let a lady cross those Badlands alone, surely? "
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_1Galar_NPC","A timely arrival! Many thanks for your help! "
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_2_Pragmatism_Default","Clear skies, friend! What's going on here? "
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_3Galar_NPC","Those… fellows joined my caravan at Coparann…"
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_4Galar_NPC","…a couple of hours ago, this man stumbled on our path, almost dead…"
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_5Galar_NPC","…no healing could help him, so I put him in a tent…"
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_6Galar_NPC","…and I was about to send word to Coparann."
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_7_Choice1Pragmatism_WRITTEN","Coparann?"
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_8_Choice1Pragmatism_Spoken","Coparann? That's where we're going!"
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_9Galar_NPC","Then perhaps you can do me a favor! "
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_10_CynicismOrElse_Default","A favor? "
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_11Galar_NPC","Of course I'll see that you're rewarded! "
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_12_Choice2Starter_WRITTEN","Almost dead?"
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_13_Choice2Starter_Spoken","Almost dead? Sick? "
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_14Galar_NPC","No, wounded! Deep wounds…"
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_15Galar_NPC","…ripped open, as if by sharp claws."
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_16Galar_NPC","We found him near the road. It looked like he had crawled there."
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_17_LawkeeperorElse_Default","Claw wounds? And no healing could help him? "
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_18Galar_NPC","That's right. The wounds were oozing."
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_19Galar_NPC","It's a wonder he was still alive."
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_20_Choice3Spy_WRITTEN","Send word? "
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_21_Choice3Spy_Spoken","Why send word?"
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_22Galar_NPC","Because this man was a corporal in the Coparann Watch. "
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_23_Starter_Default","You want us to take word of his death to Coparann."
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_24Galar_NPC","Yes - take this note and his personal effects to Sergeant Nikannen."
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_25Galar_NPC","Have him countersign the note, then see my agent."
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_26Galar_NPC","He is the owner of the general store. "
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_27Galar_NPC","Meanwhile, get some rest and share our camp!"
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_28Galar_NPC","We can even sell you some equipment!"
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_29_ArunFollower_Default","Let us share Arun's gifts!"
"AbjurationQuest_Caravan_30_Any_Default","Many thanks for your hospitality!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_1_Guard_NPC","Halt! Do you seek entrance to our fair valley?"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_2_Any_Default","Yes, we do!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_3_Guard_Npc","Then go see Sergeant Nikannen in the Guardhouse!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_4_Any_Default","Thank you! Clear skies! "
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_5_Guard_NPC","Stay in the light!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_6_SgtNikannen_NPC","Good day! I am Sergeant Nikannen, officer of the day! "
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_7_SgtNikannen_NPC","What business brings you to Coparann?"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_8_SellswordChoice1_WRITTEN","We found something."
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_9_SellswordOrElse_Slang","Well, Sarge, we found something of yours on our way here!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_10_SgtNikannen_NPC","Of mine? What, exactly?"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_11_AcademicChoice2_WRITTEN","We have something for you."
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_12_AcademicChoice2_Default","We were asked to give you certain items! "
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_13_SgtNikannen_NPC","Asked? By whom?"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_14_SgtNikannen_NPC","And what items?"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_15_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN","Galar sent us."
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_16_SpyOrElse_Default","Master Galar Goldentongue asked us to see you - and to bring these…"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_17_SellswordOrElse_Slang","Here they are, Sarge!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_18_SgtNikannen_NPC","The ring, the badge, the insignia…"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_19_SgtNikannen_NPC","The man who wore those was of middling height…"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_20_SgtNikannen_NPC","…broad shoulders, dark hair, and a broken nose. Am I right?"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_21_SpyorElse_Default","Correct! You knew him, then?"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_22_SgtNikannen_NPC","He broke his nose after an… exchange of views behind the barracks."
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_23_SgtNikannen_NPC","Roald tried to headbutt his basic training instructor. That was me!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_24_SgtNikannen_NPC","Now, tell me what happened to my good friend Roald!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_25_DiplomatOrElse_Default","First, please accept our sincere condolences! "
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_26_SgtNikannen_NPC","Thanks. Now tell me where, when, how - and who!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_27_DiplomatOrElse_Default","Two days ago."
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_28_SpyOrElse_Default","It was at a small camp in some Manacalon ruins. "
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_29_SpyOrElse_Default","He was found almost dead by the caravan people."
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_30_SpyOrElse_Default","They tried to heal him and then…"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_31_SpyOrElse_Default","…some travelers in the caravan rushed in…"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_32_SpyOrElse_Default","…to kill your friend and the guards Master Galar had posted!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_33_SgtNikannen_NPC","And no idea who those guys were? "
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_34_SellswordOrElse_Default","No, Sarge. They looked like common mercs to me! "
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_35_SgtNikannen_Default","Did Roald say anything to you? "
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_37_SgtNikannen_NPC","Dire news. Listen - go and speak to the Ceannard. Tell him everything…"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_SgtNikannen_NPC","…but leave Gromnir out of it for now."
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_AcademicOrElse_WRITTEN","The Ceannard?"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AcademicOrElse_Spoken","The Ceannard?"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AristocratOrElse_WRITTEN","Not the Baron?"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_40_AristocratOrElse_Spoken","And why not the Baron?"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_41_SgtNikannen_NPC","The Ceannard is the ruler of the Vale of Coparann."
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_42_SgtNikannen_NPC","Talk to the Ceannard first and then…"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_43_SgtNikannen_NPC","…perhaps we can discuss some more!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_44_AcademicOrElse_Default","And where is the Ceannard? "
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_45_Kythaela_NPC","But we need to talk to the Baron!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_46_SgtNikannen_NPC","You can find him at the Town Hall at this hour."
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_47_SgtNikannen_NPC","Give him this note from me and tell him exactly what happened."
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_48_SgtNikannen_NPC","You won't talk to him without my leave…"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_49_SgtNikannen_NPC","Talk to the Ceannard first and then…"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_50_SgtNikannen_NPC","Here - my signature on the letter from Galar…"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_51_SgtNikannen_NPC","Take it to Master Warmhearth at the general store."
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_52_SgtNikannen_NPC","And here's a note for the Ceannard!"
"AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_53_Any_Default","Stay in the light!"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_1_Ceannard_NPC","Clear skies! Joris Nikannen says you have an interesting story to tell! "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_2_Any_Default","Clear skies to you, my lord!"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_3_Any_Default","Well, it all began when we came upon this caravan…"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_4_Ceannard_NPC","Go on."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_5_Ceannard_NPC","Hmm… military matters I usually leave in the more than competent hands of the Baron…"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_6_Ceannard_NPC","…but Nikannen sent you to me."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_7_Ceannard_NPC","You see, he is a rarity in the Stonefist Mercenary company…"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_8_Ceannard_NPC","…the one old hand who was born here. "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_9_Ceannard_NPC","We have known each other almost all our lives!"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_10_Ceannard_NPC","He is the reason Stonefist came to our aid during the orc invasion."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_11_Ceannard_NPC","And he sent you to me? That's odd! Why did you come to Coparann? "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_12_Sellsword_WRITTEN","The Stonefist company? "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_13_Sellsword_Spoken","The Stonefist mercenary company? "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_14_Ceannard_NPC","Our military force, since they helped us repel the orc invasion!"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_15_Academic_WRITTEN","Orc invasion? "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_16_Academic_Spoken","An orc invasion? "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_17_Ceannard_NPC","Happened about fifteen years ago. Several tribes got together…"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_18_Ceannard_NPC","…whipped into a frenzy by a shaman."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_19_Ceannard_NPC","They hit us hard and opened a breach…"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_20_Ceannard_NPC","…got a foothold in the outer works, and were about to hit the town. "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_21_Ceannard_NPC","Then Gromnir hit them from behind, and they were between hammer and anvil!"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_22_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN","Stonefist?"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_23_SpyOrElse_Spoken","Who's Stonefist?"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_24_Ceannard_NPC","Gromnir Stonefist, founder of the Stonefist mercenary company!"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_Exit_WRITTEN","That doesn't answer my question."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_26_Highclass_Spoken","We are agents of the Legacy Council."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_27_Highclass_Default","Our current mission is to escort Lady Kythaela."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_28_Highclass_Default","Coparann was the seat of her family before the Cataclysm."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_29_Ceannard_NPC","And Lady Kythaela is on a nostalgia trip? "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_30_Highclass_Default","Far from it! One of her ancestors left family heirlooms hidden in the fortress. "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_31_Highclass_Default","Among those heirlooms, we hope to find clues about the next stage of our quest!"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_32_Ceannard_NPC","Old elven nobility! I am sure I have never seen you before, Lady Kythaela. "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_33_Ceannard_NPC","So tell me something about Coparann that a newcomer or even a casual visitor couldn't know."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_34_Kythaela_NPC","In a side valley, there is an Imperial mausoleum of Lanaerach, home of the honored dead!"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_35_AcademicorElse_WRITTEN","Mausoleum?"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_36_AcademicorElse_Spoken","A place of remembrance?"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_37_Kythaela_NPC","Yes, for the honored dead who fell in battle for the Empire. "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_38_Ceannard_NPC","There is indeed an ancient Imperial mausoleum in a side valley, sealed off since the Fall of Manacalon!"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_39_Ceannard_NPC","Not many know of it. Thank you, my lady - I am convinced."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_40_Sellsword_WRITTEN","Lanaerach?"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_41_Sellsword_Spoken","What's Lanaerach?"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_42_Ceannard_NPC","A very particular kind of marble - very precious! "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_43_Ceannard_NPC","The traditional stone for the honored dead!"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_44_Ceannard_NPC","As for the rest of you, you said you were sent by the Legacy Council."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_45_Ceannard_NPC","We see a lot of Council agents on their way to the Badlands, and they bring a lot of rumors."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_46_Ceannard_NPC","So tell me - is there any truth to the rumor that the Soraks are back?"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_47_AcademicorElse_Default","Yes! And they are as nasty as legends made them! "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_48_Ceannard_NPC","Can they truly possess others?"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_49_AcademicorElse_Default","Not possess, exactly…"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_50_AcademicorElse_Default","…what they do is worse…"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_51_AcademicorElse_Default","…if you believe the tales that the paladins of Einar recovered from their archives. "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_52_Ceannard_NPC","Do me a favor: walk around our city, talk to the people…"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_53_Ceannard_NPC","…then report your impressions to Sergeant Nikannen."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_54_Ceannard_NPC","Not a word about what you told me, though."
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_55_Insight15Success_Default","Do you believe the Soraks are in Coparann?"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_56_Ceannard_NPC","I'll say no more for the time being!"
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_57_Ceannard_NPC","Walk the streets, then see Nikannen! Meanwhile, stay in the light! "
"AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_58_Crownbearer_Default","Clear skies to you, Ceannard! "
"AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_1_Merchant1_NPC","It's rather silly, really. This young man…"
"AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_2_Merchant1_NPC","…he asked me for a specific design so he could propose…"
"AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_3_Merchant2_NPC","So? He probably gambled the money away!"
"AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_4_Merchant1_NPC","Not him! Straight arrow on the fast track to sergeant or higher! I asked around!"
"AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_5_Merchant2_NPC","So? Where is this paragon of yours?"
"AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_6_Merchant1_NPC","Consigned to guard duty! A whole week! And that just on his return from patrol! "
"AbjurationQuest_Seargent_1_YoungMaid_NPC","Sergeant, when can I see my Erik? He is due some liberty!"
"AbjurationQuest_Seargent_2_Sergeant_NPC","Gal, I already told ya! He's assigned to guard duty!"
"AbjurationQuest_Seargent_3_YoungMaid_NPC","A whole week of it - and that after two weeks on patrol! "
"AbjurationQuest_Seargent_4_YoungMaid_NPC","No - he just doesn't want to see me anymore."
"AbjurationQuest_Seargent_5_Sergeant_NPC","Now, gal, don't you fret! It's not that at all."
"AbjurationQuest_Seargent_6_Sergeant_NPC","The Old Man has had his whole patrol on guard duty in the basement ever since they came back! "
"AbjurationQuest_Seargent_7_Sergeant_NPC","Something's up - and whatever it is, it can't be good!"
"AbjurationQuest_Mildred_1_Bartender_NPC","Mistress Mildred! The brewer wants to know when to bring the next delivery of ale. "
"AbjurationQuest_Mildred_2_Bartender_NPC","He doesn't want it to go stale - he has his reputation to consider!"
"AbjurationQuest_Mildred_3_Mildred_NPC","If only Stonefist had let his thirsty patrol out on leave as usual…"
"AbjurationQuest_Mildred_4_Mildred_NPC","…but now, we've only the regulars and the ale's not moving too fast!"
"AbjurationQuest_Mildred_5_Mildred_NPC","Take him two empty barrels and get two new ones. It's the best we can do right now!"
"AbjurationQuest_Patrons_1_Patron1_NPC","Oh, the Ceannard's hopping mad!"
"AbjurationQuest_Patrons_2_Patron2_NPC","Why's that?"
"AbjurationQuest_Patrons_3_Patron1_NPC","A whole week he's been waiting - and still no meeting with the Baron!"
"AbjurationQuest_Patrons_4_Patron2_NPC","That's weird. Usually they meet every day, at least!"
"AbjurationQuest_Patrons_5_Patron2_NPC","Like an old couple, the two of them!"
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_1_Wilf_NPC","Well met! What can we do for you on this fine morning?"
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_2_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","We have a letter for you."
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_3_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","The Ceannard sent us."
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","Let's see your wares."
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceD_WRITTEN","We should go."
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_5_ChoiceA_Spoken","Clear skies to you! Master Goldentongue sent this letter!"
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_6_Wilf_NPC","Of course, of course!"
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_7_Wilf_NPC","Yes - Master Goldentongue's instructions are quite clear!"
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_8_Wilf_NPC","Here is your money - and here's a receipt to sign!"
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_9_Wilf_NPC","Would you be interested in sampling our wares?"
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_10_Any_Default","What do you sell?"
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_11_Wilf_NPC","A pleasure doing business with you! Stay in the light! "
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_12_Any_Normal","The Ceannard sent us to talk to you."
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_13_Any_Normal","Anything unusual in recent days?"
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_14_Wilf_NPC","The Baron came back with a bunch of prisoners. Highwaymen, apparently."
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_15_Wilf_NPC","I'm wondering why they didn't hang them on the spot!"
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_16_Any_Normal","Hanging, eh? Would that be the normal practice?"
"AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_17_Wilf_NPC","Yes. You don't need that many prisoners to make them talk, if you ask me!"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Well met again!"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC","So - you've had a chance to walk around the city and hear what people are saying?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC","What do you think?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_4_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","The soldiers."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_5_SellswordOrElse_Normal","Something is wrong. Soldiers back from a patrol denied leave…"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_6_SellswordOrElse_Normal","…posted to guard duty instead of visiting the tavern."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","These highwaymen."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_8_ChoiceB_Spoken","The story with the highwaymen is also weird. Why keep them prisoner?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal","Normally the penalty is clear and swift. "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_10_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal","On the frontier, you don't feed idle people, particularly not scum like highwaymen."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_11_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal","At best, you put them to work. At worst, they become fertilizer!"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_Temp","So what do you think?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC","There are two things I didn't mention in our last conversation."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Things about Roald and the Baron."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_14_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","Roald?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_15_ChoiceA_Spoken","What about Roald?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_16_SergeantNikannen_NPC","When you told me of Roald's death and returned his personal effects…"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC","…I was speechless, not out of grief but…"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC","…because, not a week before, Roald had come back from patrol! "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_19_Any_Default","You mean… one of them is… not who he seems."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_20_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","The Baron?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_21_ChoiceB_Spoken","What about the Baron?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_22_SergeantNikannen_NPC","I have known him for twenty years. I was a founding member of the company."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_23_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Now, for the first time in ten years, I am officer of the day, posted here."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_24_SergeantNikannen_NPC","And that's not all…"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_25_SergeantNikannen_NPC","For the last ten years he's always called me Joris. Now, all of a sudden it's back to Nikannen. "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_26_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Something is wrong. I can feel it. "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_27_SellswordOrElse_Normal","Suggestions, Sarge? "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC","The Ceannard mentioned your mission. He and I go way back. "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_29_SergeantNikannen_NPC","So - go see the baron and tell him your heirloom story."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_30_SergeantNikannen_NPC","I know what his normal reaction would be…"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_31_SergeantNikannen_NPC","…so come back and we can compare notes. "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_32_SergeantNikannen_NPC","And if I were you, I wouldn't mention Roald, the caravan, or anything else…"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_33_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Slang","As the philosopher said, we must hang together or we'll hang separately! "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_34_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Clear skies to you! "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_35_SellswordOrElse_Slang","Clear skies, Sarge! Misaye's laughing!"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_1_BaronStonefist_NPC","Greetings, adventurers. "
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_2_BaronStonefist_NPC","Sergeant Nikannen says you want to see me on some urgent matter?"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_3_DiplomatOrAristocratOrElse_Normal","Yes. It concerns our traveling companion, Lady Kythaela."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_4_BaronStonefist_NPC","Then let her speak for herself!"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_5_Kythaela_NPC","My lord, before the Cataclysm this valley was in the care of my family. "
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_6_Kythaela_NPC","Alas, only a few of us managed to survive - and none at all in the valley. "
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_7_BaronStonefist_NPC","A sad tale, my lady, but not uncommon. Those were dire times."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_8_Kythaela_NPC","My father passed away recently. Upon his death bed…"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_9_Kythaela_NPC","…he mentioned some family heirlooms left in a hidden room somewhere in the fortress. "
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_10_Kythaela_NPC","With your leave, my lord…"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_11_Kythaela_NPC","…I would like to search for this hidden room and retrieve my family's belongings."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_12_BaronStonefist_NPC","Out of the question! This is my castle and all in it belongs to me! "
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_13_BaronStonefist_NPC","Now begone - and be glad that, as a guest, you are protected by our customs…"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_14_BaronStonefist_NPC","…otherwise, your impudence would land you in the dungeon!"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Ah - you're back! How did the audience go? "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_2_CynicOrElse_Normal","Clear skies! Well, he didn't imprison us, just threw us out! "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Just threw you out? That's not like him at all!"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_4_CynicOrElse_Normal","Oh? He's not always so generous to strangers?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_5_SergeantNikannen_NPC","No - just pragmatic and smart! "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","Pragmatic?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_7_ChoiceA_Spoken","Pragmatic?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_8_SergeantNikannen_NPC","It would be cheaper to let you find the heirlooms, under close escort."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_9_SergeantNikannen_NPC","He'd demand a fee, but it's easier than having to search for himself!"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","Smart?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_11_ChoiceB_Spoken","Smart?"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Of course, smart! If we assume Lady Kythaela's story is true…"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC","…then arresting her or coercing her could have drawn the ire of an elven clan."
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_14_SergeantNikannen_NPC","A pretty stupid move for stuff which might only have sentimental value! "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_15_SergeantNikannen_NPC","So, not like Gromnir at all!"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_16_SellswordOrElse_Normal","Fine. What do you suggest? "
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Let me make some preparations. You go back to him tomorrow…"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC","…as envoys of the Legacy Council!"
"AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","So, what's the plan?"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_1_Baron_NPC","Sergeant Nikannen, why are you bringing these people to me again?"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC","My lord, they showed me credentials that I thought you should see."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_3_Baron_NPC","Credentials? What do credentials have to do with Lady Kythaela's claims? "
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_4_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal","We're from the Legacy Council."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_5_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal","My lord, we are deputies of the Legacy Council!"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_6_Baron_NPC","And the Legacy Council interferes in Coparann's affairs?"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_7_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","Quite the contrary, my lord…"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_8_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","…the Council would appreciate Coparann's help."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_9_Baron_NPC","Why didn't you say so yesterday? "
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_10_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","We do not flaunt our allegiance unless there is need, my lord!"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_11_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","Lady Kythaela works for the Legacy Council."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_12_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","Lady Kythaela has agreed to help the Council…"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_13_AcademicOrElse_Normal","…in a delicate and vital matter."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_14_Baron_Normal","And what's that?"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Historical research."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_16_Baron_NPC","Those… baubles have some historical value?"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_17_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","We believe so, my lord. We wouldn't be here otherwise."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_18_Baron_NPC","Then why not just say so?"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Confidential matters are best handled confidentially, my lord."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_20_Baron_NPC","Then - ah, shall we search for these heirlooms together? "
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_21_Baron_NPC","I shall escort you and we'll inventory the… historical items."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_22_Baron_NPC","Then we can discuss a reasonable share for the keep."
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_23_Kythaela_NPC","That would be more than fair, my lord!"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_24_Baron_NPC","Then please lead the way! Where should we start? "
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_25_Kythaela_NPC","In the basement, my lord! "
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_26_Baron_NPC","Let's go, then! Nikannen, you were right to bring them to me! "
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_27_Baron_NPC","Now, back to your post!"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC","Yes, my lord!"
"AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_29_MeetYouThere","Go. I'll meet you in the basement."
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_1_Kythaela_NPC","Here! This is the place! "
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_2_Baron_NPC","And so near the dungeons. How subtle - and fitting. "
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_3_Baron_NPC","Please, Lady Kythaela, before we inventory your heirlooms…"
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_4_Baron_NPC","…there is something I wish to show you."
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_5_Baron_NPC","You will find it interesting, hopefully."
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_6_Baron_NPC","So nice of you to drop by. "
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_7_Baron_NPC","Now we shall all have a nice, long chat together! "
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_8_Baron_NPC","And you will tell us everything!"
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_9_Baron_NPC","Ah - and guards… Gromnir has outlived his usefulness!"
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_10_EinarOrElse_Formal","Einar be your judge! "
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_11_Baron_NPC","And you will give me that Crown!"
"AbjurationQuest_Basement_12_SeeingTheBaron","Is that… the Baron?"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_1_Baron_NPC","Lady Kythaela, dear friends - words aren't enough to convey my thanks! "
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_2_Baron_NPC","Your swift action has saved my life - and our vale! "
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_3_Baron_NPC","We shall be more wary of the Council's warnings…"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_4_Baron_NPC","…the Soraks are real."
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_5_Baron_NPC","This changes our position towards the Council."
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","Warnings?"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","About the Council…"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_8_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","About the Soraks…"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_9_ChoiceA_Spoken","The Council warned you?"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_10_Baron_NPC","Indeed. I thought they exaggerated, alas!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_11_Baron_NPC","If anything, they weren't loud enough!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_12_DiplomatOrElse_Default","But we can only warn! "
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_13_Ceannard_NPC","You are right to do so, but in such matters, only conviction and proof are effective!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_14_SellswordOrElse_Slang","Soraks are real - you saw them with your own eyes."
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Their presence was a clear message: be wary! Be careful!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_16_Ceannard_NPC","True! We won't let our guard down! "
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_17_Any_Default","How does this change your position?"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_18_Ceannard_NPC","Coparann must stand with the Council!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Do you plan to join the Council?"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_20_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Or simply to help us in our endeavors? "
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_21_Ceannard_NPC","We shall join! The discovery of the hidden Gate…"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_22_Ceannard_NPC","…will allow us to communicate swiftly!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_23_Ceannard_NPC","But enough about matters of state!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_24_Baron_NPC","The Ceannard has the right of it! "
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_25_Baron_NPC","The only benefit of power is the ability to reward friends!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_26_Ceannard_NPC","And true friends of Coparann you have proven to be!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_27_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal","Thanks for your kind words! We feel quite rewarded."
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_28_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Hush, you! Ceannard, Lord Stonefist - many thanks for your kind words!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_29_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","And praise be your resilience, so we could rescue you alive!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_30_Baron_NPC","That resilience would have amounted to nothing…"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_31_Baron_NPC","…without your insight and your courage! "
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_32_Baron_NPC","You are hereby granted permanent citizenship of Coparann, with all associated rights!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_33_Baron_NPC","As well as free use of our rediscovered Gate!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_34_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal","The keys to the town, maybe?"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_35_Baron_NPC","And these gems from our mines are well suited to holding enchantments."
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_36_Baron_NPC","Go forth on your journey with our blessings!"
"AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_37_DiplomatOrElse_Normal","Many thanks for your generous gifts! May Einar watch over Coparann!"
"AbjurationQuest_Tower_1_Kythaela_NPC","This is the place!"
"AbjurationQuest_Tower_2_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal","And it's had recent visitors. Look here in the mud - a boot print."
"AbjurationQuest_Tower_3_Perception15Success_Normal","And the rain has only just stopped! Let's be careful!"
"AbjurationQuest_Tower_4_Perception15Failure_Normal","Difficult to read anything here."
"AbjurationQuest_Tower_5_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal","Lady Kythaela! Do you know how to enter the Tower?"
"AbjurationQuest_Tower_6_Kythaela_NPC","Yes!"
"AbjurationQuest_Tower_7_Crownbearer_Normal","Let's head there now! "
"AbjurationQuest_Tower_8_BroodB_NPC","Not so fast!"
"AbjurationQuest_Tower_9_BroodD_NPC","The feast is just starting!"
"AbjurationQuest_Tower_10_BroodF_NPC","And you will make a nice main dish!"
"AbjurationQuest_Razan_1_Kythaela_NPC","Master, here I am, at last!"
"AbjurationQuest_Razan_2_Adrasteia_NPC","Kythaela, come to me! "
"AbjurationQuest_Razan_3_Starter_Normal","Kythaela could use some healing, I think!"
"AbjurationQuest_Razan_6_Razan_NPC","Yes, dazzle us! Allow me to thank you for your actions!"
"AbjurationQuest_Razan_7_Razan_NPC","I have tried for years to open that door! And here you are!"
"AbjurationQuest_Razan_8_Razan_NPC","An answer to my prayers! It would almost lead me to believe…"
"AbjurationQuest_Razan_9_Razan_NPC","…in the benevolence of the gods! Albeit my very existence proves otherwise!"
"AbjurationEnding_1_Adrasteia_NPC","You have my thanks, whoever you are."
"AbjurationEnding_2_Crownbearer_Normal","You're welcome, I guess. But your thanks for what exactly? "
"AbjurationEnding_3_Adrasteia_NPC","For reuniting me with Kythaela."
"AbjurationEnding_4_Adrasteia_NPC","For dealing with this… foulness when I was incapacitated."
"AbjurationEnding_5_Adrasteia_NPC","This evil was new to me, not something Manacalon ever knew."
"AbjurationEnding_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","Reuniting? "
"AbjurationEnding_7_ChoiceA_Spoken","Reunited with her?"
"AbjurationEnding_8_Adrasteia_NPC","Yes, Kythaela was - or even is - a part of me! "
"AbjurationEnding_9_Judgmental_Normal","Did you kill her? "
"AbjurationEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal","Careful, now!"
"AbjurationEnding_11_Adrasteia_NPC","No, It is also me speaking, my friend, and your care is much appreciated!"
"AbjurationEnding_12_Insight_20_Success_Normal","Kythaela was your clone? "
"AbjurationEnding_13_Insight_20_Failure_Normal","I don't understand what happened here!"
"AbjurationEnding_14_Adrasteia_NPC","Kythaela was a last-ditch contingency - one I didn't truly think I would ever need!"
"AbjurationEnding_15_Adrasteia_NPC","A vessel for my knowledge and memories!"
"AbjurationEnding_16_AcademicOrElse_Normal","But how did she awaken, a thousand years after the Cataclysm? "
"AbjurationEnding_17_Adrasteia_NPC","The revival process was tied to an ambient level of mana."
"AbjurationEnding_18_AcademicOrElse_Normal","Very high-level magic, then!"
"AbjurationEnding_19_Adrasteia_NPC","One of the secrets of the Arcaneum, yes!"
"AbjurationEnding_20_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","Incapacitated? "
"AbjurationEnding_21_ChoiceB_Normal","Incapacitated? "
"AbjurationEnding_22_Adrasteia_Spoken","Yes, the merging process takes time - time during which I was almost helpless!"
"AbjurationEnding_23_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","Never seen such a creature?"
"AbjurationEnding_24_ChoiceC_Normal","Never met such a creature before? "
"AbjurationEnding_25_Adrasteia_NPC","No. Manacalon, for all its faults, revered life!"
"AbjurationEnding_26_Adrasteia_NPC","This was a negation of life, an abomination!"
"AbjurationEnding_27_AcademicOrElse_Normal","Manacalon? Are you one of the… ?"
"AbjurationEnding_28_Adrasteia_NPC","Adrasteia the Prudent Shield, Master of Abjuration. In your debt, and at your service! "
"AbjurationEnding_29_AcademicOrElse_Normal","You were at the battle of the Rift?"
"AbjurationEnding_30_Adrasteia_NPC","Yes, and there I must apologize for Kythaela's misconceptions."
"AbjurationEnding_31_AcademicOrElse_Normal","Misconceptions? "
"AbjurationEnding_32_Adrasteia_NPC","Yes. She was created with an elven personality, and carried certain… prejudices."
"AbjurationEnding_33_AcademicOrElse_Normal","Oh, that."
"AbjurationEnding_34_Adrasteia_NPC","The Empire wasn't kind to… other races."
"AbjurationEnding_35_AcademicOrElse_Normal","The humans surprised you, it seems."
"AbjurationEnding_36_Adrasteia_NPC","Yes - such bravery, such defiance! "
"AbjurationEnding_37_Adrasteia_NPC","They all came together to save Solasta! "
"AbjurationEnding_38_Adrasteia_NPC","The Golden Cavalry charging and breaking the lines of the Sorr-Akkath! "
"AbjurationEnding_39_Adrasteia_NPC","The Iron Legions and the Shield Wall of the dwarves…"
"AbjurationEnding_40_Adrasteia_NPC","…holding the enemy at bay, flank to flank!"
"AbjurationEnding_41_Adrasteia_NPC","Our shock arcanists and the human paladins together…"
"AbjurationEnding_42_Adrasteia_NPC","…giving their lives to give us a chance to close the Rift!"
"AbjurationEnding_43_Adrasteia_NPC","And, as another wave came through…"
"AbjurationEnding_44_Adrasteia_NPC","…one last throw of the dice…"
"AbjurationEnding_45_Adrasteia_NPC","…one last surprise for the Sorr-Akkath! "
"AbjurationEnding_46_AcademicOrElse_Normal","What was it?"
"AbjurationEnding_47_Adrasteia_NPC","Kaseinax had us walking Solasta in elven form for so long…"
"AbjurationEnding_48_Adrasteia_NPC","…but at this moment we resumed our true forms!"
"AbjurationEnding_49_Adrasteia_NPC","To secure the Rift for a few crucial moments…"
"AbjurationEnding_50_Adrasteia_NPC","…buying time with our lives in a furnace of magic and steel! "
"AbjurationEnding_51_Adrasteia_NPC","So Kaseinax finished his ritual!"
"AbjurationEnding_52_AcademicOrElse_Normal","With the gems."
"AbjurationEnding_53_Adrasteia_NPC","Take it, old friend, once again."
"AbjurationEnding_54_Crownbearer_Normal","Old friend?"
"AbjurationEnding_55_Adrasteia_NPC","I feel your spirit in the Crown, Kaseinax! "
"AbjurationEnding_56_AcademicOrElse_normal","The Magister is still in the Crown? "
"AbjurationEnding_57_Adrasteia_NPC","Enough talk of the past."
"AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC","Please accept these few tokens of my gratitude!"
"AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC2","I must rest now. I foresee one last flight, when the need is greatest…"
"AbjurationEnding_59_Adrasteia_NPC","…and for that, I will need all my strength."
"AbjurationEnding_59_Adrasteia_NPC2","Use my Gate freely. I believe you know how."
"AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC","We shall meet again, before the end!"
"AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC2","But before you take your leave, if you would be so kind…"
"AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC3","This creature you forced to flee still plagues my grounds with his minions."
"AbjurationEnding_61_Adrasteia_NPC","Would you deal with them and free their prisoners? "
"AbjurationEnding_62_Adrasteia_NPC","As a courtesy."
"AbjurationEnding_63_Any_Default","We owe you that much. Thank you, Master Adrasteia."
"AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Welcome","Welcome to the inn!"
"AbjurationMildred_Tavern_StayForTheNight","Sure! Get settled!"
"AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Nomoney","No coin, no bed."
"AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Goodbye","Stay in the light!"
"Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_1_Atima_NPC","Sun on your face, travelers!"
"Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_2_Atima_NPC","My name is Atima Bladeburn, priestess of Arun."
"Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_3_Arun_Default","A herald of fire?"
"Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_4_Atima_NPC","It is my honor."
"Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_5_Atima_NPC","What can I do for you?"
"Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_6_Arun_Default","Just passing by to pay our respects."
"Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_7_Cynical_Default","Not me."
"Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_8_Atima_NPC","Then good luck and fair weather, friends."
"Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_9_Any_Default","Stay in the light!"
"Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_10_Any_Default","We need your powers."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_1_Ceannard_NPC","Gromnir! Thank Einar you're safe! "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_2_BaronStonefist_NPC","Yes, I am - thanks to Joris and these adventurers, it seems!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_3_Ceannard_NPC","Now, old friend - go see Atima with Joris! "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_4_BaronStonefist_NPC","I'm fine!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_5_Ceannard_NPC","I knew you'd say that."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_6_Ceannard_NPC","I am the Ceannard, and you…"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_7_Ceannard_NPC","…you shall resume your duties only if our cleric says you're fit enough."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_8_BaronStonefist_NPC","But -"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_9_Ceannard_NPC","No buts! I shall secure the Keep and the valley till you're back!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_10_Ceannard_NPC","As for you, my friends, find Lady Kythaela's belongings…"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_11_Ceannard_NPC","…and meet me in the throne room."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_12_CrownbearerOrHighestHistory_Formal","Strike true!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_12_CrownbearerOrHighestHistory_Normal","Will do."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_1_CrownbearerOrArcane_Highest_Normal","Tell us, Lady Kythaela, what did you find? A gem? "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_2_Kythaela_NPC","This is my spellbook - I remember!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_2b_Kythaela_NPC","A wand, a robe, some money, and a piece of paper."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_3_CrownbearerOrHighestInsighet_Normal","What does it say?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_4_Kythaela_NPC","I… don't know. There is only one word written on the paper: ""Adrasteo"""
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_5_SarcasticOrElse_Normal","Is that another place?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_6_Kythaela_NPC","I… I'm not sure! I feel the pull returning!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_7_InsightOrElse_Normal","I guess we'll soon be on the road again, then."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_8_SarcasticOrElse_Normal","More monsters to kill… fantastic…"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_9_PerceptionHighest_Normal","What about that door? Another secret from Imperial times?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_1_ArcanaHighest_Normal","A Major Gate! Captain Ironshell was right."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_2_Sarcastic_Normal","About the cleanliness of the rooms in the Residence?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_3_ArcanaHighest_Normal","About functional Gates, you dimwit!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_4_Sarcastic_Normal","This dusty old room?   "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_5_ArcanaHighest_Normal","Yes, look at it! It's perfectly intact."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_8_Kythaela_NPC","It is locked, though."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_9_InsightHighest_Normal","How do we unlock it?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_10_Kythaela_NPC","You need to use its name. "
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_11_Kythaela_NPC","It would normally be engraved nearby, but this was a private, secret Gate."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_12_Pragmatic_Normal","So, we can't use it?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_13_Kythaela_NPC","I know its name, this was my family's."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_14_Pragmatic_Normal","So…?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_15_Kythaela_NPC","Once you get me to my master, I'll give you the name."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_16_Pragmatic_Normal","I guess that's fair."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_17_Friendly_Normal","And then, we teleport to Caer Cyflen?"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_18_Friendly_Normal","That's fantastic!"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_19_Pragmatic_Normal","I'm not sure the Ceannard will want to wait."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_20_Kythaela_NPC","Then I'll give him the name, but you still have to stay with me."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_21_Cynical_Default","She's tough, but at least she doesn't sound crazy anymore."
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_22_Kythaela_NPC","Watch your words, you…"
"AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_23_Kythaela_NPC","…never mind."
"CradleOfFire_Arriving_1_Default_Default","This is the worst place we've been so far."

"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_8_Selfpres_Default","Encouraging…"
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_9_Selfpres_Default","About this so-called holy axe… what is it?"
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_10_Kebra_NPC","Holy axe was of ancestor of orcs, legend says, brought from the Endless Range."
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_11_ChoiceA_WRITTEN","Ancestors?"
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_12_ChoiceB_WRITTEN","Endless Range?"
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_13_ChoiceC_WRITTEN","Forget it."
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_14_ChoiceA_Default","Orcs have ancestors?"
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_15_Any_Default","Orcs born out from Great Collapse, from its magic."
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_16_Any_Default","Ancestors were great warriors from the Endless Range."
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_17_ChoiceB_Default","What's the Endless Range?"
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_18_History_Default","A name for the plains of Tirmar."
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_19_Default_Default","Orcs were Tirmarian?"
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_20_History_Default","No."
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_21_Any_Default","We don't have time for historical debates."
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_22_ChoiceC_Default","We know enough."
"CradleOfFire_BladefangQuest_23_Choice3_Default","Let's find this Old Queen, then."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_1_Default_NPC","Webs?"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_2_Selfpres_NPC","Oh, no? That's what the Old Queen is? Another spider?"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_3_Violent_Default","We can deal with a spider."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_4_Default_Default","Even two."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_5_Violent_Default","But a very, very big deep spider."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_6_Selfpres_Default","Come on! How big can it be?"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_01_7_Cynical_NPC","We should bring its head back to the Council. Faisech will love it."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_1_Pragmatic_Default","What happened?"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_2_Arcana_Default","It's magical darkness."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_3_Selfpres_Default","We need light! It's an extra-super big deep spider!"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_4_Default_Default","And it has anti-light magic?"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_5_Selfpres_Default","This is insane! Let's go back!"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_6_Selfpres_Default","I'd rather kill all the orcs in that damned volcano than walk down this spider pit in the pitch dark."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_7_Pragmatic_Default","There has to be a way."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_1_Cynical_Default","I promise I'll never scoff at 'anything is possible in the Badlands' again."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_2_Pragmatic_Default","At least we got it."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_3_Pragmatic_Default","Hopefully, that means another orc tribe behind us."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_4_Greed_Default","You really want to give up this axe?"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_5_Greed_Default","Look at it? it's a masterpiece!"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_6_Nosy_Default","Tirmarian smiths were just as good as the elves of Manacalon!"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_7_Nosy_Default","This axe is fantastic!"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_8_Greed_Default","I say we keep it."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_9_Authority_Default","The gem's more important - and to get that, we need to give the axe to Bladefang."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_1_Radulf_NPC","Brok is back with nyarks?"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_2_Radulf_NPC","Have the…"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_3_WRITTEN_Pragmatic","Here, your axe."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_4_WRITTEN_Greed","We'll keep it."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_5_Pragmatic_Default","Here it is, your holy axe."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_6_Radulf_NPC","I knew it was real!"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_7_Radulf_NPC","It is magnificent."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_8_Cynical_Default","Nice vocabulary."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_9_Radulf_NPC","You made Bladefang more powerful than ever!"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_10_Radulf_NPC","We follow you against Arrok!"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_11_Greed_Default","It was too hard to get it, it's ours now."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_12_Radulf_NPC","But axe is orc inheritance."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_13_Greed_Default","It's Tirmarian, not orc."
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_14_Radulf_NPC","Pah! Should know better than trust nyarks!"
"CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_15_Radulf_NPC","Leave Bladefang. Now."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_1_Default_Default","Look at that! Another library!"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_2_Default2_Default","It looks very like the tower where we found the Crown."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_3_History_Default","But it's makeshift, not Manacalon."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_4_Kebra_NPC","Home of Sandraven, and Shaman Urka."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_5_Nosy_WRITTEN","Why the Manacalon style?"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN","Tell us about the Sandraven tribe."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_7_Authority_WRITTEN","Let's go."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_8_Nosy_Default","Why is this place made of Manacalon remnants?"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_9_Kebra_NPC","Urka very wise shaman."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_10_Kebra_NPC","Reads books."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_11_Nosy_Default","Orcs can read?"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_12_Cynical_Default","Amaaazing."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_13_Pragmatic_Default","What should we know about Sandraven?"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_14_Kebra_NPC","Urka loves old elf stuff."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_15_Kebra_NPC","Ask you to bring back some, for sure."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_16_Kebra_NPC","But his tribe can fight, useful for facing Arrok."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_17_Authority_Default","Let's do this. I think they've seen us, anyway."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_18_Urka_NPC","Kebra?"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_19_Urka_NPC","I thought you were dead."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_20_Urka_NPC","Who are your nyark… friends?"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_21_Kebra_NPC","They help me and Brok. We gather all tribes against Arrok."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_22_Urka_NPC","Oh, Arrok."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_23_Authority_Default","Urka, eh?"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_24_Urka_NPC","Yes."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_25_Authority_Default","We need your tribe to support Brok's challenge against Arrok."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_26_Urka_NPC","Hmmm. First, bring me the key to the sunken city."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_27_Authority_Default","What's that?"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_28_Urka_NPC","Down in the Cradle of Fire is a Manacalon city called Sentharyllian."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_29_Urka_NPC","It melted into the mountain, since the Great Collapse."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_30_Urka_NPC","But Arrok… he found it first."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_31_Urka_NPC","Found his stone of power there."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_32_Urka_NPC","Now, no one can enter, unless…"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_33_Urka_NPC","…unless you go through the Necropolis."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_34_Urka_NPC","Find the Emperor's key."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_35_Urka_NPC","Bring it back to me, and my tribe will support Suncloud."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_36_Choice1_WRITTEN","It's a deal!"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_37_Choice2_WRITTEN","Arrok is already in the city."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_38_Choice3_WRITTEN","The Emperor's key?"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_39_Choice4_WRITTEN","It must be very dangerous."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_40_Choice4_Default","If Arrok the powerful didn't go there, it must be awfully dangerous."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_41_Urka_NPC","Not more than facing Arrok without help."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_42_Choice3_Default","What is this key?"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_43_Urka_NPC","It is said that the Emperor was buried with a magical key that opens the city."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_44_Urka_NPC","So find his tomb and bring me the key."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_45_Choice2_Default","Why do you want that key if Arrok is already inside the city?"
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_46_Urka_NPC","Arrok only found a part of the city."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_47_Urka_NPC","The key will open many more rooms… to me."
"CradleOfFire_SandRaven_48_Choice1_Default","All right, we'll bring you the key."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_1_Default_Default","I think that's the Necropolis."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_2_Selfpres_Default","Orcs don't go there? I really can't see why."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_3_Authority_Default","Let's go find this key."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_1_Default_Default","That's a change of mood."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_2_Nosy_Default","Fantastic! It's like traveling back in time a thousand years!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_3_Selfpres_Default","Well, it still stinks of sulfur."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_1_Default_Default","So far, this looks more like a museum than a crypt."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_2_History_Default","Manacalon custom. The tombs of the powerful have a hall of honor before the burial chamber."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_3_Greed_Default","It's a map of the Manacalon Empire! It must be a thousand years old - maybe more!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_4_Cynical_Default","So, they really did rule the world."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_5_Greed_Default","This is invaluable. I should compare it to our own map."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_6_History_Default","Here - this is Hickory Corner Wood! I've been there, and there's nothing but an old statue. The map shows an outpost!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_7_Pragmatic_Default","Maybe it's buried, like this city."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_8_Authority_Default","Let's put that on our map - maybe someday we can go check it out."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_1_History_Default","We have our answer - this isn't just any tomb."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_2_Cynical_Default","Yeah, it's a damned Imperial slaver's tomb."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_3_Lawful_Default","We know…"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_4_History_Default","This one was Laethar Aerlinn, first of his name."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_5_Pragmatic_Default","In the middle of the Badlands, and not in the capital city? That's weird."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_6_History_Default","It might have been displaced during the Cataclysm and sunk down here. "
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_7_Lawful_Default","I would have expected something bigger, fancier."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_8_Cynical_Default","Maybe he was a modest Emperor - if such a thing's possible."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_9_Authority_Default","We still need to find an entrance to the city. Let's go!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_1_History_Default","Prince Kealin, firstborn."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_2_Violent_Default","His son? Never got to be Emperor - died too soon."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_3_Cynical_Default","Murdered, most likely. Happy families, and all that."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_4_Authority_Default","Let's go."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_1_History_Default","Queen Saefinala, dearest wife and mother."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_2_Cynical_Default","Cute."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_3_Lawful_Default","Show some respect."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_4_Carver_Default","Slavers, the whole lot of them."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_1_Ghost_NPC","Who dares disturb the eternal rest of Emperor Laethar?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_2_Default_WRITTENONLY","We mean no disrespect."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_3_Deception_WRITTENONLY","We got lost."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_4_Persuasion_WRITTENONLY","We're clearing your city of orcs."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_5_Intimidation_WRITTENONLY","We go where we like."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_6_Intimidation_Answer01","This isn't your world anymore - we can go wherever we like!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_7_Ghost_NPC","Fool!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_8_Ghost_NPC","Your souls will never leave this tomb!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_9_Persuasion_Answer02","Your city is infested with orcs. We're here to clean it up."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_10_Ghost_NPC","What are orcs?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_11_Cynical_Default","Smart move!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_12_Persuasion_Default","Evil monsters. They're desecrating your city."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_13_Deception_Answer03","We just got lost, sorry."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_14_Ghost_NPC","Lies of a tomb robber!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_15_Default_Answer04","We mean no disrespect."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_16_Ghost_NPC","Then what do you mean?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_17_Ghost_NPC","Monsters, you say? "
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_18_Ghost_NPC","Clearly, you are runaway slaves. You will be punished!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_19_Violent_Slang","I've had enough of this. Let's kill this loser - again!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_20_Violent_Normal","Enough of this! Let's wipe this slaver's ghost from Solasta!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_21_Persuasion_Default","We call them orcs, they're like… dwarves, but worse."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_22_Ghost_NPC","Really?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_23_Ghost_NPC","Then you are on a sacred mission."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_24_Ghost_NPC","Monsters must not defile a city of the Emperors."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_25_Ghost_NPC","Leave this holy tomb and do what you must."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_26_Ghost_NPC","There is Minor Gate by the tapestry of the Aer Elai. Use it to reach the inner city."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_27_Persuasion_Default","Thank you, your Imperial Majesty."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_1_Pragmatic_Default","Did you see that?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_2_Cynical_Default","The ghost? Yes, we did."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_3_Pragmatic_Default","The key! It's in the coffin."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_4_Selfpres_Default","Oh, no!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_5_Pragmatic_Default","So what do we do?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_6_Cynical_Default","Wake him up again and ask nicely?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_7_Violent_Default","Get ready for a fight."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_8_Pragmatic_Default","Why don't we just go into the city and kill Arrok?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_9_Selfpres_Default","Which is worse? Fighting Arrok by ourselves, or this dead Emperor?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_1_Ghost_NPC","You again?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_2_Cynical_Normal","Sorry, your Imperialness. We just need that pretty key of yours."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_3_Cynical_Formal","Our apologies, Emperor, but your time has long gone."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_4_Cynical_Slang","Time to die for good, dead boy!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_5_Ghost_NPC","Liars! Traitors!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_1_Authority_Default","Urka!"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_2_Urka_NPC","I must say, I am impressed."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_3_Selfpres_Default","You followed us?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_4_Urka_NPC","So you don't have to bring the key back to me."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_5_Selfpres_Default","You really want that key, don't you?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_6_Urka_NPC","Actually, I wanted the ghost to weaken you."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_7_Urka_NPC","Make it easier to take that Crown from you."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_1_Kebra_NPC","Urka? How? I know him since… child."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_2_Lawful_Default","The Soraks - the gaks - they got to him, I guess."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_3_Kebra_NPC","But, all these orcs, too?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_4_History_Default","The Soraks took over a whole world back on Tirmar."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_5_Kebra_NPC","The Crown? It can stop them?"
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_6_Authority_Default","We think so - hope so."
"CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_7_Kebra_NPC","You need Arrok's stone, for real."
"CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_1_Brok_NPC","Nyark friends. You convince the tribes?"
"CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_2_Authority_Default","Bad news. Urka was corrupted by the gaks."
"CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_3_Brok_NPC","Urka? Big mind like him?"
"CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_4_Kebra_NPC","I saw him. Like crazy. The gaks can do this."
"CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_5_Brok_NPC","Maybe Arrok is gak, too?"
"CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_6_Authority_Default","Doesn't matter now, we need to take the fight to him."
"CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_7_Brok_NPC","But Sandraven?"
"CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_8_Kebra_NPC","You choose a chief for them, and they follow you."
"CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_9_Default_Default","Also, Radulf will not come."
"CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_10_Default_Default","We couldn't reach an agreement."
"CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_11_Brok_NPC","Hm. Meet us near Redscar gate."
"CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_12_Default_Player","What is that?"
"CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_13_Brok_NPC","Redscar gate. Arrok's fortress."
"CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_14_Violence_Player","Can't we just kill the guards and go in?"
"CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_15_Brok_NPC","Door is magic. "
"CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_16_Brok_NPC","But Arrok will open if challenged."
"CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_17_Brok_NPC","We need the tribes."
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_1_History_NPC","Can't get used to these Minor Gates. To think they had these everywhere!"
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_2_Pragmatic_Default","Now's not the time for Manacalon nostalgia."
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_3_Kebra_NPC","Look!"
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_4_Authority_Default","Is that…?"
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_5_Kebra_NPC","Arrok!"
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_6_Cynical_Default","That did the trick, eh?"
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_7_Selfpres_Default","What are these burned corpses everywhere?"
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_8_Kebra_NPC","Orcs. Didn't please Arrok, I suppose."
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_9_Cynical_Default","Well, looks like he did half the job for us."
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_10_Authority_NPC","Do we need the tribes, now?"
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_11_Violent_NPC","I reckon we can take him - we have the advantage of surprise."
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_12_Kebra_NPC","Arrok still very powerful."
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_13_Violent_NPC","Sure. So we need to take him down fast."
"CradleOfFire_InsideCity_14_Selfpres_NPC","We can still backtrack and follow the plan."
"CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_1_Cynical_Default","Uh-huh."
"CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_2_Arrok_NPC","Ah, Kebra of Suncloud…"
"CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_3_Arrok_NPC","…you walk with nyarks? Shame on you."
"CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_4_Authority_Default","You're finished, Arrok. Give us the stone!"
"CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_5_Arrok_NPC","Funny nyark. No, you give me yours."
"CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_6_Authority_Default","You're alone. Looks like you killed your tribe all by yourself."
"CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_7_Arrok_NPC","Useless worms."
"CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_8_Arrok_NPC","Arrok needs no orcs. Arrok is fire! Arrok is volcano!"
"CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_9_Selfpres_Default","What the…"
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_1_Authority_Default","Brok!"
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_2_Authority_Default","Where are the guards?"
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_3_Brok_NPC","Surrendered."
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_4_Default_Default","What?"
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_5_Brok_NPC","So afraid of Arrok, they joined us already."
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_6_Cynical_Default","No big speech, then?"
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_7_Brok_NPC","No, but door still closed."
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_8_Crownbearer_Default","Do you see that?"
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_9_Cynical_Default","The door?"
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_10_Crownbearer_Default","No, there is a… power."
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_11_Crownbearer_Default","I think, though… with the Crown… we might be able to enter."
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_12_Selfpres_Default","It's a trap. Arrok wants us in there alone."
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_13_Pragmatic_Default","Do we have a choice?"
"CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_14_Default_Default","There's always the Necropolis."
"CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_1_Nosy_Default","Is that gem more powerful than the others?"
"CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_2_Arcane_Default","Orc shamans wield a very peculiar type of magic…"
"CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_3_Arcane_Default","…the gem must have been some sort of catalyst."
"CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_4_Pragmatic_Default","Well, we have it now. Let's move before this place blows up!"
"CradleOfFire_Ending_1_Selfpres_Default","That was close!"
"CradleOfFire_Ending_2_Friendly_Default","What do you think happened to…"
"CradleOfFire_Ending_3_Friendly_NPC","…our orc friends?"
"CradleOfFire_Ending_4_Selfish_Default","You mean yours. They're no friends of mine."
"CradleOfFire_Ending_5_Violent_Default","Burned dead… who cares?"
"CradleOfFire_Ending_6_Friendly_Default","They seem more civilized than I expected."
"CradleOfFire_Ending_7_Violent_Default","Next time we run into some, you can tell them that."
"CradleOfFire_Ending_8_Authority_Default","All right, let's get out of here. It's not safe!"
"Conjuration_Entrance_1_Crownbearer_Default","This is it, I think! It's just behind this wall of vegetation!"
"Conjuration_Entrance_2_CynicOrElse_Default","You think? That's comforting. And how do we get through? "
"Conjuration_Entrance_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default","Just hack and slash, rinse and repeat, until we're through! "
"Conjuration_Entrance_4a_CynicOrElse_Default","I've heard that before…"
"Conjuration_Entrance_4b_CynicOrElse_Default","…a couple of hundred times since we started…"
"Conjuration_Entrance_4c_HighestCharismaIfNotCynicOrnotCynic_Default","Oh, come on! Less bitching and more hacking!"
"Conjuration_Entrance_5_LowestSTRorElse_Default","I so love manual labor! "
"Conjuration_Entrance_6_FollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default","It's Maraike's will!"
"Conjuration_Jungle_1_CynicOrElse_Default","I think my arm's about to drop off from all this hacking!"
"Conjuration_Jungle_2_SellswordorElse_Slang","Chop, don't talk!"
"Conjuration_Jungle_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default","Come on, guys! It's just another hedge! "
"Conjuration_Jungle_4_LowestSTRorElse_Default","Last freakin' hedge I intend to cut through in my lifetime! "
"Conjuration_Jungle_5_RogueOrFollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default","Misaye's laughing!"
"Conjuration_Lava_1_LowestSTRorElse_Default","Such a wonderful coincidence to get a sauna after all the physical exertion!"
"Conjuration_Lava_2_SellswordorElse_Slang","Stop moaning - it was just a nice warm-up!"
"Conjuration_Lava_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default","I have dealt with worse! Not often, though!"
"Conjuration_Lava_4_CynicOrElse_Default","Hard to believe! "
"Conjuration_Lava_5_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default","Einar strike down me if I lie!"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_1_SpyOrElse_Default","Now, my friend - it's time for a little chat."
"Conjuration_Interrogation_2_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","I'll give you nothing! Sorr-Tarr will protect me from your torture!"

"Conjuration_Interrogation_4_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","This place will be the death of you, too! It is cursed! Its magic is twisted!"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","This place? How did you get here? "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_Written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","How did you come to this place? "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_6a_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","We were sent by our chosen one! "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_7a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","An acolyte of Sorr-Tarr…"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_6a1_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","Blessed be his name."
"Conjuration_Interrogation_7a1_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","How did he locate the place? "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_7a2_Intimidation_DC20_Default","Ever heard of the Inquisition? Talk to us now!"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_8a1_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Success_NPC","The chosen one worked some magic. "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_8a2_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Failure_NPC","The Inquisition? Pah! Nothing you can do to me can beat the horrors of this place!"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","This place is cursed? "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","What curse? "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_6b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","Don't you have eyes? Didn't you see the fate of my brethren?"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_7b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","Won't lose sleep over it! What is cursed? "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_8b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","This very place! Everything seemed peaceful, and then…"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_9b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","Who said what? "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_10b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","The voice! It said we would all die!"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_11b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","Because I know we will all die here! It said so! "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_12_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","Disturbing claims! "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_13_SpyOrCautious_Default","Sure, all these dead Soraks, and no trace of what killed them…"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_14_SpyOrCautious_Default","…but we saw dead Soraks everywhere…"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_15_SpyOrCautious_Default","…and not one single enemy body among them! "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_16_Lawkeeper_Default","They could have taken their dead, just like the Soraks do."
"Conjuration_Interrogation_17_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","And what do we do with our friend here? "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_18_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","He is a Sorak pawn - there is only one thing to do! "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_19_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","And yet, we have laws! "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_20_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","He's too dangerous! "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_21_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","Who are we, to call ourselves judges and executioners?"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_22_AnyPriestOrPaladin_Default","Servants of the gods!"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_23_AnyNonHuman_Default","Protectors of Solasta!"
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default","Those statues look weird!"
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_2_Sellsword_Slang","Perhaps - but those chests look mighty real to me!"
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_3_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","But are we entitled to it? "
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_4_Sellsword_Slang","What do you mean? "
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_5_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","So far, we haven't met a living soul in this labyrinth!"
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_6_CynicOrElse_Default","And your point being?"
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_7_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","That we would be stealing from the owner!"
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_8_SellswordOrGreed_Default","Naaah - spoils of war!"
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","But we want his help, remember - stealing makes a bad impression, usually."
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_10_SellswordOrGreed_Default","Can we just take a peek first? We don't have to take anything. "
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_11_SellswordOrGreed_Default","Just a look, right? "
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_12_LawkeeperOrElse_Default","All right, but don't make me regret it! "
"Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_13_SellswordOrGreed_Default","Oooops… Sorry? "
"Conjuration_Beast_1_Beast_NPC","And so the thieves come to meet their doom!"
"Conjuration_Beast_2_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal","There are no thieves here! "
"Conjuration_Beast_3_Beast_NPC","Do you deny helping yourselves to the riches outside this room?"
"Conjuration_Beast_4_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal","We were looking for clues and then we were attacked…"
"Conjuration_Beast_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default","…by some constructs that really, really wanted to kill us!"
"Conjuration_Beast_6_Beast_NPC","Hah! The constructs wouldn't have attacked…"
"Conjuration_Beast_7_Beast_NPC","…if you had just looked! "
"Conjuration_Beast_8a_SellswordOrGreed_Default","Had to make sure they weren't fake!"
"Conjuration_Beast_8b_LawkeeperOrAltruist_Default","We didn't even have a chance to put them back! "
"Conjuration_Beast_9_Beast_NPC","You stole! Otherwise, there would have been no fight! "
"Conjuration_Beast_10_Beast_NPC","And there is only one punishment for theft!"
"Conjuration_Beast_11_Beast_NPC","Death!"
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_1_SellswordOrGreed_Slang","This is my kind of fight!"
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_2_Crownbearer_Default","Well, I can relate to that, but I also wonder… "
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default","Wonder about what?"
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_4_Crownbearer_Default","Why all of this? Why the traps, why the fights?"
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_5_NosyOElse_Default","Not to forget the how! "
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_6_Crownbearer_Default","This gem fragment… resonates with the Crown but…"
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_7_NosyOElse_Default","Apparently, the gem was split… to protect it, maybe? "
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_8_Crownbearer_Default","That would explain the traps and monsters."
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_9_NosyOElse_Default","It's one way to make sure this gem is safe! "
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Default","But what does it mean?"
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_NosyOElse_Default","That another Master survived the Cataclysm."
"Conjuration_BeastEnding_11_Cynic_Default","Someone who doesn't like visitors. "
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","What was that? Where are we? "
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_2_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal","You had to step on it! "
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_3_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal","Find us a way back! "
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_4_NosyOrElse_Formal","Friends, we'll have to think this through! We're a team."
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_5_CynicOrElse_Normal","And watch where you put your hands in future."
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_6_SellswordOrGreed_Normal","Don't you loot everything you find?"
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_7_NosyOrElse_Normal","I'm not a Scavenger, mind you."
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_8_SellswordOrGreed_Normal","Stop it!"
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_9_SellswordOrGreed_Normal","…while we wait for you to finish pondering all the…"
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_10_SellswordOrGreed_Formal","…theoretical and practical implications of everything we do?"
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_11_NosyOrElse_Normal","Nothing wrong with using one's brain, my musclebound friend!"
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_12_CrownbearerOrAuthority_Normal","Enough! Let's find a way out of this trap…"
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_13_CrownbearerOrAuthority_Normal","By brawn or brains, I don't care which!"
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","I just felt something!"
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_2_NosyOrElse_Normal","Like what? "
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","Like the floor gave a little under my weight! "
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_4_NosyOrElse_Formal","Well, this tile does look a little different! "
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_5_NosyOrElse_Normal","Spread out! Look for similar tiles!"
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_6_SelfishnessOrGreed_Normal","What's in it for me? "
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_7_NosyOrElse_Normal","A way out! Unless you have a better idea?"
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","It worked! The platform shifted!"
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_2_NosyOrElse_Normal","True - but we're not out of this… labyrinth yet! "
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","True!"
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_4_NosyOrElse_Formal","We've made progress, though! Let's keep going!"
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_5_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","Let's spread out and explore!"
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_6_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal","Professional trap-finders first!"
"Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_7_RogueOrHighestPerception_Normal","Did someone just call for my expertise? "
"Conjuration_Coward_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","Interesting light, that. Very bright."
"Conjuration_Coward_2_nosyOrElse_Normal","Wonder what it's about?"
"Conjuration_Coward_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal","Only one way to find out! Come on!"
"Conjuration_Coward_4_Arcana_DC20_Failure_Normal","Looks like a will-o'-the-wisp to me! "
"Conjuration_Coward_5_Arcana_DC20_Success_Normal","How fascinating! A new wonder to behold! "
"Conjuration_Coward_6_RogueOrElse_Normal","Not so fast! There have been enough traps so far to…"
"Conjuration_Coward_7_RogueOrElse_Normal","…make me really nervous!"
"Conjuration_Coward_8_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal","You and me both, my friend! "
"Conjuration_Coward_9_Crownbearer_Normal","Let's tread carefully, then! "
"Conjuration_Coward_10_RogueOrAcolyte_Normal","Today is Misaye's birthday! "
"Conjuration_Coward_11_ClericOrWorshipMaraike_Normal","Maraike's will be done! "
"Conjuration_Coward_12_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal","Next time, pray harder for a miracle! "
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_1_HighestPerception_Slang","Einar's sword! What a sight! "
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_2_NosyOrHistoryOrElse_Formal","Unbelievable!"
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_3_HistoryDC15_Success_Formal","A classical Manacalon manor! What a wonderful sight! "
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_4_HistoryDC15_Failure_Formal","What a weird old building!"
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_5_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal","Guys, I move two steps back and well… it's gone!"
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_6_HighestPerception_Normal","What is gone? "
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_7_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal","This manor! Something weird is going on!"
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_8_HighestPerception_Normal","Story of my life!"
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_9_CynicOrElse_Normal","Weird gets us money and fame! "
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_10_AcolytOrElse_Normal","Do you really have to be so… greedy?"
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_11_CynicOrElse_Normal","Not greedy; practical! We do things…"
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_12_CynicOrElse_Normal","…that no one in their right minds would attempt…"
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_13_CynicOrElse_Normal","…and we don't do it for nothing!"
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_14_HelpfulnessOrFriendliness_Normal","Speak for yourself! A good deed is a good deed!"
"Conjuration_MansionArrival_15_CynicOrElse_Normal","Then let's get in there and see what kind of weirdness we find!"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_1_Butler_NPC","Good day to you. My name is Eldorath Smooth-Tongue, the master's housekeeper."
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2a_1_Butler_ifPlayersLooted_NPC","I see you have purloined some of my master's property…"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2a_2_Butler_ifPlayersLooted_NPC","…might I suggest you put those trinkets back where they belong? "
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2b_1_Butler_ifPlayersNoLoot_NPC","Welcome."
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2b_2_Butler_ifPlayersNoLoot_NPC","Please come with me."
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_3_CrownbearerOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal","Clear skies to you! Where are you taking us?"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_4_Butler_NPC","To the master, of course! "
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_5_Crownbearer_Normal","And who would that be? "
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_6_Butler_NPC","That is for not for me to say. All will be made plain in good time."
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_7_Butler_NPC","I am at your disposal. Please enjoy our hospitality - but…"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_8_Butler_NPC","…please don't abuse it."
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","We are grateful for your hospitality."
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_written_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Hospitality? "
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10a_Butler_NPC","We aim to please. The household has certain standards, after all."
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11a_Butler_NPC","We have not seen guests of your… quality for some time."
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Some time? How long, exactly? "
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13a_Butler_NPC","Well, it must be… forgive me, the date eludes me for the moment."
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_14a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Do you remember any… prominent guests? "
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_15a_Butler_NPC","You were there, Master Kaseinax!"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_16a_Crownbearer_Normal","Me? "
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_17a_Butler_NPC","I remember it distinctly. Though your form was somewhat different."
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","We would never dream of abusing your hospitality!"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9b_written_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Someone abused your hospitality in the past?"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10b_Butler_NPC","Yes, believe it or not, some… creatures can be…"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11b_Butler_NPC","…insufferably rude!"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","True nobility is reflected in the character!"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13h_Butler_NPC","Quite so! Not, of course, that I thought for a second…"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_14b_Butler_NPC","…that you would be capable of such discourtesy."
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_15b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Of course not! And yet, customs being different everywhere…"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_16b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","…might I ask what would be considered rude here? "
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_17b_Butler_NPC","Well, my expectations don't exceed those of the Imperial court!"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_18b_Cynic_Slang","So, don't piss in the potted plants, then? "
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_19b_Butler_NPC","Preferably not. Not that it would be the first time…"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_20b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal","Really? "
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_21b_Butler_NPC","I have seen worse, I'm sorry to say!"
"Conjuration_CastleEntrance_22b_Butler_NPC","But now, please follow me. One mustn't keep the master waiting! "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_1_Master_NPC","Well met, strangers!"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_2_Master_IfplayersStole_NPC","Ah, my little thieving visitors."
"ConjurationQuest_Master_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal","Clear skies to you, master."
"ConjurationQuest_Master_4_Master_NPC","Clear skies? An ironic greeting, considering my plight! "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal","Your plight? "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_6_Master_NPC","That I haven't taken to the skies in a long time! "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_7_Master_NPC","It must have been a thousand years…"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_8_Master_NPC","I am… "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_9_Master_NPC","How weird, I can't recall my name…"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_10_Master_NPC","Call me master."
"ConjurationQuest_Master_11_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal","Master of Conjuration!"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_12_Master_NPC","Yes, yes yes ! The Master of Conjuration! Exactly! "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_13_Crownbearer_Formal","Greetings, old friend!"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_14_AnyButCrownbearer_Normal","Why do you call him that?"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_15_Crownbearer_Normal","The Crown… told me to."
"ConjurationQuest_Master_16_Master_NPC","Ah, the Crown…"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_17_Master_NPC","…thank you for coming to my rescue. "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_18_Master_NPC","My mind was shattered since the Cataclysm."
"ConjurationQuest_Master_19_Master_NPC","The vanishing of mana left me broken."
"ConjurationQuest_Master_20_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal","Mana was gone? "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_21_Master_NPC","Of course, after the closing of the Rift!"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_22_Master_NPC","That's why I and my siblings were killed or crippled."
"ConjurationQuest_Master_23_Master_NPC","Kaseinax, and us, the masters, along with these deities…"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_24_Master_NPC","…we poured everything we had to close and seal that Rift! "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_25_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal","So the Cataclysm is… your fault? "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_26_Master_NPC","It was the price to pay to stop the threat."
"ConjurationQuest_Master_27_Master_NPC","The Sorr-Akkath were and still are a menace to Solasta."
"ConjurationQuest_Master_28_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal","And so you took a gamble? "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_29_Master_NPC","We were born to rule, not to grovel!"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_30_Master_NPC","And we had sworn to protect our people! "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_31_AnyNonElf_Normal","You mean your slaves?"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_32_Master_NPC","Fool! Imperial rule brought order where there was only chaos!"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_33_Master_NPC","But your empire was destroyed."
"ConjurationQuest_Master_34_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal","Who knows how many elves were killed?"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_35_Master_NPC","Ah! Because you believe that Manacalon was an elven empire!"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_36_Master_NPC","Enough about the past! "
"ConjurationQuest_Master_37_Master_NPC","Now I get that you want my gem."
"ConjurationQuest_Master_38_Master_NPC","But even with his Crown, you're not my Magister!"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_39_Master_NPC","So, if you want it…"
"ConjurationQuest_Master_40_Master_NPC","…you'll have to pry it from my dead claws!"
"Banter_ToM_07","Kill them!"
"Banter_ToM_08","Intruders!"
"Banter_ToM_09","Don't let them get away!"
"Banter_ToM_10","They're crazy!"
"Banter_ToM_11","They'll kill us if we don't fight back!"
"Banter_ToM_12","I stepped on some kind of magical rune. I guess there's a reason for that."
"Banter_ToM_13","Found one!"
"Banter_ToM_14","Eh… nothing. Very funny."
"Banter_ToM_15","Another one, here."
"CaerLem_Nego23_Spy_Default","Alright, I'm opening it."
"Banter_SwitchToCautious","We should be careful."
"PriestOfArun1_Priest_NPC","Sun on your face, travelers!"
"PriestOfArun2_Arun_Default","Balance and harmony, chaplain!"
"PriestOfArun3_Priest_NPC","Fair weather, faithful one."
"PriestOfArun4_Priest_NPC","Good luck and fair weather!"
"ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_16_DalonLark_NPC","Did you find any relics of interest in our fight against the Sorr-Akkath?"
"Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_01","Charming little town…"
"Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_02","Access to the canyon is blocked!"
"Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_03","You can't get to the other side - move on!"
"Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_04","You are not allowed to cross this bridge."
"Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_01","Careful - I heard something!"
"Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_02","What were these goblins doing here?"
"Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_03","There must be some reason."
"Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_04","Look - it works!"
"Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_05","It's something, isn't it?"
"Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_06","This is where they're coming from."
"Atima_Bladeburn_Goodbye","Just passing by."

"Introduction_Stealth_LiamArrives","Liam! What are you doing here? I told you I'd take care of it!"
"CaerLem_InTunnel9_Default","Wait… Lisbath stayed back?"
"CaerLem_InTunnel10_Default","She was broken."
"CaerLem_InTunnel11_Default","They're gonna kill her!"
"CaerLem_InTunnel12_Default","If we go back for her, we die, too."
"CaerLem_InTunnel13_Default","But… Fine… you're probably right."
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_01","There's something strange about this place."
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_02","I feel like someone's watching us."
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_03","Looks kinda familiar, don't you think?"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_04","It's too quiet!"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_05","This is huge!"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_06","Did you see that?"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_07","A Defiler. It vanished!"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_08","We should be careful. We're not alone."
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_01","Master, I'm coming!"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_01","I can see something in the water."
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_02","There's something under the ground."
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_01","Friends are always welcome at the Shield!"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_02","Peasants probably lived in these outbuildings."

"Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_03","We should come back at night."
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_09","A spectacular place, isn't it?"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_10","Are they… ghosts?"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_11","What other wonders does this place contain?"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_12","Let's stay on guard."

"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_09","Unbelievable, an intact copy of the History of the Elven Wars by the First Loremaster of the Arcaneum!"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_10","This harp - look at the grain of this wood, the patina… it hasn't aged a day, seems anachronistic… And a 48-stringer!"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_11","Knowing Manacalon, it could be anything! And I bet we don't have enough mana to make it work!"
"Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_07","It looks like a pattern that needs to be reproduced in some way…"
"Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_08","This is a poem in elvish… about the moonlight?"

"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_16","""Principles of Architecture"", by Karhelas Grayhand! He designed the Teansolais, the imperial palace of Siothyrnas!"
"Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_17","This is… Eiradir Fairmind, the justicar, as he presents the first codex of imperial law to the Court!"
"Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_01","Wait? Have you ever seen this kind of plant?"
"Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_02","The gem must be in this forest. One last effort and it will be ours."
"Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_03","I knew it, we shouldn't have touched that sticky equipment."
"CradleOfFire_Entrance_3_Arbal_NPC","Who your nyark friends?"
"CradleOfFire_Entrance_4_Arbal_NPC","Eh, nyark speaks! Kebra teach them?"
"CradleOfFire_Entrance_10_Arbal_NPC","Before Arrok, Arbal would kill nyarks."
"CradleOfFire_Entrance_13_Arbal_NPC","Not nice, no."
"CradleOfFire_Entrance_15_Orcishspeaker_Default","Ah! Thank you, nyark - that make my day."
"Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_04","It's too thick, we won't make it like this!"
"Banter_Conjuration_TheID_01","What was that? Where are we?"
"Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_00","Go back to where you came from, you insignificant beings. You are not worthy to enter."
"Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_01","I laugh at the emptiness of your actions."
"Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_02","Play the wise, you fools. Go ahead."
"Banter_Conjuration_TheID_DarkCave_1","Let's stay together. These caves are dark and full of terrors."
"Banter_Conjuration_TheID_DarkCave_2","Do you remember where we come from?"
"Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Greed_1","It's too easy… "
"Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_01","The gem, we found it!"
"Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_02","Where are the Soraks?"
"Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Beast_Observable_1","The gold just disappears in my hands!"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_01","Edrof says gate closed for now."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_02","Bloodspear tribe is strong!"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_03","Nyark go talk to Edrof. Only he give order to open passage."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_04","Brok strong chief! He defeated Edrof."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_01","Kebra survived! Kebra strong."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_02","Nyark want to trade?"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_03","Bloodspear strong tribe! Bloodspear plenty."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_04","Nyarks friend with Brok. Brok strong chief!"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_01","Nyarks go see Radulf!"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_02","Radulf great Shaman."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_03","Nyark got mighty axe?"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_04","Nyarks have spider webs in hair."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_01","Brok new chief? Brok not dead?"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_02","Nyarks need food?"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_03","Bladefang best tribe. Bladefang got big shaman!"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_04","Kebra friend with nyarks?"
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_01","Bring back the greataxe and I will consider an alliance."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_02","This sigil will unlock the door to my challenge."
"TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_03","No greataxe means we are not joining you."
"Tavern_02_41_Player_Default","Go easy on him. He's just a harmless, old drunk."
"Tavern_02_42_Player_Default","Probably saw lizardfolk, or dragonborn, or something…"
"Tavern_02_43_Merton","You think I don't know the difference?"
"Tavern_02_44_Merton","All those spines on their backs, those jaws - you've never seen anything like it!"
"Tavern_02_45_Merton","Not lizardfolk, not troglodyte, not dragonborn. I'm telling you!"
"Tavern_02_46_Player_Default","No one believes in Soraks anymore."
"Tavern_02_47_Player_Default","Except the Church of Einar, of course - there's a Sorak under every bed if you believe them."
"Tavern_02_48_Player_Default","Easy, now. Don't mock people for their faith."
"Tavern_02_49_Merton","Read them books. Soraks are masters of deception, infiltration…"
"Tavern_02_50_Merton","…anyone here could be a Sorak, you'd never know."
"Tavern_02_51_Player_Default","Oh, come on!"
"Tavern_02_51_Merton","You'll see."
"Tavern_02_52_Player_Default","Anyway…"
"Tavern_01_2b_Explorer_Default","Is this the place for the Legacy Council job? Hope I'm not too late."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_Choiceb","The Council's very new. How does it work, exactly?"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01b","Dear Maraike! You don't know?"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_Player01b","Well, we know that each of the Eastern Kingdoms has a delegation…"
"Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02b","No - not the kingdoms. The Council is a neutral, academic body - in theory, at least."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03b","It's true, though, that each delegation is from a different nation."
"Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04b","Except for the Church of Einar. They are here to ensure fair dealings."
"Council01_70b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","Our church has been warning of the Sorr-Akkath since humans first came to Solasta…"
"Council01_71b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze","…in the wake of their foul god Sorr-Tarr!"
"Council03_37b_Einarboss_NPC","Their foul god Sorr-Tarr knows. He is guiding them."
"Council03_37c_Einarboss_NPC","We tried to leave him - and them - behind on Tirmar. It seems we failed."
"Council03_41b_Antiquariansboss_NPC","Conjecture perhaps, but the evidence points in that direction."
"Council03_42b_Einarboss_NPC","Now they want the Crown. We may not know why, but we do know they must not have it!"
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_01","Yes… I understand."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_02","Who are you talking to? Wait - what are you doing?"
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_03","Are you crazy? Why did you put it on?"
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_04","We have no idea what it does, whether it's evil, or anything!"
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_05","What? I… Oh. I… It… I just… kind of… had to."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_06","We're supposed to share the loot, by the way."
"TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_08","Forget it, let's get out of here."
"NecromancyQuest01_39b_Fighter_Default","Are they all undead in there?"
"NecromancyQuest01_41_Default","Undead? What other abominations are in there?"
"NecromancyQuest01_42_Default","Undead? What types? Are they free or enslaved?"
"NecromancyQuest01_43_Default","Undead? That's not good. And you deal with them?"
"NecromancyQuest01_44_Default","Undead. I might have known. Anything goes out here, it seems."
"NecromancyQuest04_06b_Intimidate_Default","There's nowhere in the world where necromancy isn't a crime. "
"NecromancyQuest04_37b_Player","A defiler? A blood-drinking Child of Sorrow?"
"NecromancyQuest04_37c_Player","Twice-cursed defilers! They are the worst of the undead!"
"NecromancyQuest04_44_Player","Stay in the light! It is our only protection."
"NecromancyQuest04_45_Player","Maraike will protect us. Her powers are strong against these abominations."
"NecromancyQuest05_11b_Kill_Default","Abomination! The light of Einar will destroy you!"
"NecromancyQuest05_11c_Kill_Default","Twice-cursed monster! Prepare to die - again!"
"CaerLem_InTunnel4b_Cynicism_Default","Right out of a fairytale, as ugly as life."
"CaerLem_InTunnel4c_Cynicism_Default","And certainly not lizardfolk."
"CaerLem_Darik21b_Player","So - big, walking lizards with spikes all over their backs?"
"CaerLem_Darik21c_Player","Except for the one who looked just like your Captain, of course."
"CaerLem_Darik21d_Player","Was he one of them all along, do you think?"
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4b_History_Default","Doesn't have the big spines…"
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_10_Default","It's standing just like a human. Ever seen a dragon do that?"
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_11_Default","Ever seen a dragon at all? How would you know?"
"TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_12_Default","Stop losing time, it's just a statue."
"TowerOfMagic_Discovery_01","Look at this place! I've never seen so many books!"
"TowerOfMagic_Discovery_02","It would take a lifetime to read them all! Even for an elf!"
"TowerOfMagic_Discovery_03","Must be worth a fortune! If only we could get everything back to Caer Cyflen…"
"TowerOfMagic_Discovery_04","I see the point of the Scavengers now…"
"TowerOfMagic_Discovery_05","Why not keep this to ourselves?"
"TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_01","Crap! The book just turned into dust!"
"TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_02","Damn! This book is… not really here!"
"TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_03","Do you mean all this fortune is out of reach?"
"TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_04","The library is trapped within this… magical phenomenon."
"TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_05","I should have known… it was too good to be true."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_22_Religion_Default","That's an old Tirmarian symbol. It stands for Arivad."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_23_Religion_Default","He was a Tirmarian god, but he didn't come to Solasta."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_24_Religion_Default","I can't remember much more."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_25_Einar_Default","""A"" stands for Arivad - an evil god from old Tirmar. I read about him."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_26_Einar_Default","The Soraks call him Sorr-Tarr. ""Sorr-Akkath"" means ""beloved of Sorr-Tarr"" in their tongue."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_27_Lowlife_Default","I've heard whispers of cultists with an ""A"" tattoo."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_28_Lowlife_Default","There's a name, too: ""Arivad."""
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_29_Default","These humans are Arivad cultists, in league with the Soraks."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_30_Default","We better be careful."
"TowerOfMagicFight1over_31_Default","And don't forget, we need the head of a Sorak."
"InTemple_1_Crowbearer_Default","Lord Sunblaze - thank you for you hospitality."
"InTemple_2_EinarBoss_NPC","It's the least we can do for the deputies who proved that there are still Soraks on Solasta."
"InTemple_3_EinarBoss_NPC","You've proved we cannot relax our vigilance."
"InTemple_4_EinarBoss_NPC","Did you find anything else that could help us track them?"
"InTemple_5_EinarBoss_NPC","There was a parchment. "
"InTemple_6_EinarBoss_NPC","If you find it, send for the Tshar."
"InTemple_7_Curious_NPC","You can read that?"
"InTemple_8_EinarBoss_NPC","That last word, it's not Tirmarian… it's in the Sorr-Akkath tongue."
"InTemple_9_Selfpres_NPC","I knew it!"
"InTemple_10_EinarBoss_NPC","It means ""general."""
"InTemple_11_EinarBoss_NPC","You were wise to run."
"InTemple_Added_1_Player_Default","Also, the fanatics we fought near that old tower…"
"InTemple_Added_2_Player_Default","…they all had this tattoo on their arm."
"InTemple_Added_3_Player_Default","And we found this letter."
"InTemple_Added_4_Player_Default","It seems to support the idea that they were working for the Soraks under duress."
"InTemple_Added_5_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","It is indeed one of their ways. "
"InTemple_Added_6_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Now this, is the A of Arivad."
"InTemple_Added_7_Player_Default","Can you enlighten us?"
"InTemple_Added_8_Player_Default","Between the myth and what we've seen, it's confusing."
"InTemple_Added_9_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Of course."
"InTemple_Added_10_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","We paladins and clerics of Einar are the guardians of these memories."
"InTemple_Added_11_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Our ancestors fought the war against the Sorr-Akkath."
"InTemple_Added_12_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Their god, Sorr-Tarr, gave them dark powers of treachery, mind reading, and shapechanging."
"InTemple_Added_13_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","They infiltrated the human society, corrupted the hearts of men."
"InTemple_Added_14_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","At some point, everyone was suspected to be a Sorak in disguise."
"InTemple_Added_15_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Distrust broke humanity. Sorr-Tarr had won. "
"InTemple_Added_16_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","He corrupted even Arivad, god of the inquisitors."
"InTemple_Added_17_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The gods themselves decided to run away from Tirmar."
"InTemple_Added_18_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","They opened the rift for the humans to escape, to Solasta."
"InTemple_Added_19_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Many of them didn't make it. It was a tragedy."
"InTemple_Added_20_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","At the site of the rift, thousands of Soraks tried to cross."
"InTemple_Added_21_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Sorr-Tarr himself tried."
"InTemple_Added_22_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The rift was closed, in a gigantic blast."
"InTemple_Added_23_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Our kings and heroes, Manacalon's masters of magic, were all wiped out."
"InTemple_Added_24_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","So, how could Soraks have survived, escaped and then thrived on Solasta?"
"InTemple_Added_25_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","I supposed that's another one of their tricks."
"InTemple_Added_26_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","But for those who had survived the war, the exodus…"
"InTemple_Added_27_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","…it was paramount to stay vigilant, to keep the memory alive."
"InTemple_Added_28_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The memory of what Soraks were, what they could do."
"InTemple_Added_29_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","So that, if one day, they were to return."
"InTemple_Added_30_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","We'd be ready."
"InTemple_Added_31_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","I'm sorry to say, after a thousand years, only few of us remain."
"InTemple_Added_32_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Most people believe Soraks are a mere legend, now."
"InTemple_Added_33_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","But you brought us proof."
"InTemple_Added_34_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The Soraks are not extinct."
"InTemple_Added_35_NO_AUDIO","Are there different Soraks?"
"InTemple_Added_36_Player_Default","We fought different ones, do you know more?"
"InTemple_Added_37_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The bulk of their army are foot soldiers, with poisoned spines."
"InTemple_Added_38_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","They breed a cast of albino priests, able to cast spells."
"InTemple_Added_39_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Some of them are deadly assassins - invisible, venomous."
"InTemple_Added_40_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Others are giant brutes."
"InTemple_Added_41_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The scriptures talk of elite warriors, anti-paladins."
"InTemple_Added_42_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","The Shikkath."
"InTemple_Added_43_NO_AUDIO","Can they mimic people?"
"InTemple_Added_44_Player_Default","Can they really impersonate people?"
"InTemple_Added_45_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","It's been proven, though it's a long process."
"InTemple_Added_46_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","They used to kidnap a target, study it for weeks, sometimes months."
"InTemple_Added_47_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","One of their chosen ones would transform into a perfect duplicate."
"InTemple_Added_48_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","Upon death, they would return to their original form."
"InTemple_Added_49_NO_AUDIO","Why do people follow them?"
"InTemple_Added_50_Player_Default","How do they get people to worship them?"
"InTemple_Added_51_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","They get into people's minds…"
"InTemple_Added_52_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","…learn their darkest secrets, their fears, their shameful desires."
"InTemple_Added_53_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","With that, they can blackmail, corrupt, and finally recruit."
"InTemple_Added_54_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC","It's much easier for them than to duplicate, and very efficient."
"InTemple_Added_55_Player_Default","Well, that's all very scary, but thanks, it's going to help us."
"InTemple_Added_56_Player_Default","You're welcome, deputies."
"InTemple_12_EinarBoss_NPC","If you find anything else connected to the Sorr-Akkath or their allies, bring it to the Temple."
"InTemple_13_EinarBoss_NPC","Talk to Chaplain Dalon Lark. You will be well rewarded."
"InTemple_14_EinarBoss_NPC","Whenever you're ready, the Council will meet again."
"Council02_Final1_Gormdsottir_NPC","Deputies!"
"Council02_Final2_Gormdsottir_NPC","Your report speaks of a library in a tower of magic?"
"Council02_Final3_Any_Default","Yes, madam."
"Council02_Final4_Gormdsottir_NPC","That is incredible! Do you realize the historical value?"
"Council02_Final5_Any_Default","Well, all these books are either floating above a chasm or… disappear on touch."
"Council02_Final6_Gormdsottir_NPC","What? So all this knowledge is not accessible?"
"Council02_Final7_Any_Default","It's going to take a lot of time to check the place entirely."
"Council02_Final8_Any_Default","And it may not be totally safe."
"Council02_Final9_Any_Default","Scavengers are going to establish an outpost, I suppose."
"Council02_Final10_Gormdsottir_NPC","This is an incredible finding, deputies. Thanks for your service."
"Council02_Final11_Any_Default","You're welcome."
"Council02_Final12_Any_Formal","Chancellor."
"Exposition1_Beric_NPC","Four new members, all recommended by trusted citizens."
"Exposition2_Gormsdottir_NPC","We should deputize them right away."
"Exposition3_Beric_NPC","They will be pretty green. Let's wait for Captain Merran to return."
"Exposition4_Gormsdottir_NPC","We can't wait. Three weeks without any news?"
"Exposition5_Gormsdottir_NPC","Everybody in Caer Lem might be dead already."
"Exposition6_Gormsdottir_NPC","Lord Stonebeard is eager to send troops to rescue his daughter."
"Exposition7_Beric_NPC","Only Council forces may enter the Badlands! Otherwise, the treaty is broken, and it's war."
"Exposition8_Gormsdottir_NPC","That's why we need to hire more Council deputies, even if they're not tested!"
"Exposition9_Gormsdottir_NPC","Way too many people are waiting for the Council to fail!"
"Exposition10_Gormsdottir_NPC","Oh, look, the Legacy Council doesn't work! Nobody wants to join it!"
"Exposition11_Gormsdottir_NPC","Let's invade the principality and take the Badlands' treasures first!"
"Exposition12_Beric_NPC","I know. The Council must hold."
"Exposition13_Beric_NPC","Let's get our new deputies to work."
"CarranTalk_1_Carran_NPC","Lord Carran, we'd like to ask you a few questions."
"CarranTalk_2_Player_Default","Again?"
"CarranTalk_3_Carran_NPC","Well, I'm here at your service, deputies."
"CarranTalk_4_WRITTEN_A","Ask for details about the geography."
"CarranTalk_5_WRITTEN_A1","Ask for details about the Principality."
"CarranTalk_6_WRITTEN_A2","Ask for details about the Badlands."
"CarranTalk_7_WRITTEN_A3","Ask for details about the Eastern Kingdoms."
"CarranTalk_8_WRITTEN_B","Ask for details about the politics."
"CarranTalk_9_WRITTEN_B1","Ask for details about the Council."
"CarranTalk_10_WRITTEN_B2","Ask for details about the factions."
"CarranTalk_11_WRITTEN_B3","Ask for details about the Scavengers."
"CarranTalk_12_WRITTEN_ChangeTopics","Change the general topic."
"CarranTalk_13_Player_Default","Can you explain again the Legacy Council's purpose?"
"CarranTalk_14_Carran_NPC","Really? Right."
"CarranTalk_15_Carran_NPC","The position of the Copperhead Road puts the Principality in a strategic position…"
"CarranTalk_16_Carran_NPC","…to exploit the ancient knowledge and treasures that come out of the Badlands."
"CarranTalk_17_Carran_NPC","The Council makes sure everyone has equal access, so no one's tempted to invade."
"CarranTalk_19_Player_Default","Why are you recruiting adventurers?"
"CarranTalk_18_Carran_NPC","To scout the Badlands and the Marches that surround them…"
"CarranTalk_20_Carran_NPC","…and bring back whatever can be recovered. Antiquities, magical lore, anything."
"CarranTalk_21_Carran_NPC","Then the Council makes sure everyone gets a chance to study it."
"CarranTalk_22_Carran_NPC","We want people who will swear allegiance to the Council, and not to one nation."
"CarranTalk_23_Carran_NPC","It's a… fresh idea. I'm afraid it hasn't had much success so far."
"CarranTalk_24_Carran_NPC","Captain Merran is a great example for beginners."
"CarranTalk_25_Carran_NPC","But the events in Caer Lem… well, we lost almost all of our people there."
"CarranTalk_27_Carran_NPC","Captain Henrik's demise sends the wrong message."
"CarranTalk_28_Carran_NPC","Lord Stonebeard, an influential member of the Snow Alliance is also very…"
"CarranTalk_29_Carran_NPC","…doubtful about the whole concept."
"CarranTalk_30_Carran_NPC","I thought you knew, since you're in it…"
"CarranTalk_31_Player_Default","What can you tell us about the Scavengers?"
"CarranTalk_32_Carran_NPC","I would say: don't be fooled by the name."
"CarranTalk_33_Carran_NPC","Some of them were already exploring the Old Empire before the Copperhead Road…"
"CarranTalk_34_Carran_NPC","…when it was near impossible to get through the mountains and into the Badlands."
"CarranTalk_35_Carran_NPC","Most of them are now providing services to adventurers, and the Council."
"CarranTalk_36_Carran_NPC","I supposed you've already met Annie Bagmordah, her leader."
"CarranTalk_37_Carran_NPC","What factions are in play here?"
"CarranTalk_38_Carran_NPC","The Circle of Danantar is based here in the Principality."
"CarranTalk_39_Carran_NPC","His leader, Lord Edvan Danantar, is a renowned Spellblade master."
"CarranTalk_40_Carran_NPC","The Guild of Antiquarians is from the Snow Alliance, to the north."
"CarranTalk_41_Carran_NPC","They crave anything of historical value, even mundane items…"
"CarranTalk_42_Carran_NPC","…as long as they're old enough."
"CarranTalk_43_Carran_NPC","The Tower of Knowledge is from the Kingdom of Gallivan…"
"CarranTalk_44_Carran_NPC","…they are academics, interested in all kinds of… well, knowledge."
"CarranTalk_45_Carran_NPC","The Arcaneum is from the New Empire…"
"CarranTalk_46_Carran_NPC","…magic is their passion, especially ancient, Manacalon magic."
"CarranTalk_47_Carran_NPC","You're welcome, deputies."
"CarranTalk_48_Carran_NPC","And… stay in the light."
"CarranTalk_49_Carran_NPC","I'll be here to answer your questions…"
"CarranTalk_50_Carran_NPC","…unless I'm busy with Council affairs."
"Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_01","Where are we landing this time? "
"Banter_Conjuration_TheSuperEgo_02","The lake shouldn't be dried up with such a flow coming from the river."
"Banter_Conjuration_TheID_02","What do you think? Fight or leave?"
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_2_Self_PreservationOrSelfishness_Normal","You had to touch it!"
"Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_3_Self_PreservationOrSelfishness_Normal","Find us a way back! "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_9b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","…magic came out of nowhere! Targeting us! "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_10b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","And how is that a curse? "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_12b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default","Who said what? "
"Conjuration_Interrogation_13b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","The voice! It said we would all die!"
"Conjuration_Interrogation_14b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC","After each death, it… it said it again!"
"Conjuration_GardenShed_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default","Freeze, Soraks! "
"Conjuration_GardenShed_2_Sellsword_Slang","Time to show them who we are! "
"Conjuration_GardenShed_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default","They haven't seen us yet! No need to rush!"
"Conjuration_GardenShed_4_Sellsword_Slang","It comes down to the same thing in the end!"
"Conjuration_GardenShed_5_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default","Look - they've gone into that shed! "
"Conjuration_GardenShed_6_SpyOrHighestperception_Default","It's pretty small for so many Soraks. Tunnel entrance?"
"Conjuration_GardenShed_8_NotHighestInt_Default","No reason to wait, they're gone."
"Conjuration_GardenShed_9_HighestWisorElse_Default","What if they come out?"
"Conjuration_GardenShed_8_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default","We'll kill them."
"Conjuration_SorakFight1_Starter_Default","What just happened?!"
"Conjuration_SorakFight2_Cynical_Default","A gem… right?"
"Conjuration_SorakFight3_Cynical_Default","Just like that."
"Conjuration_SorakFight4_Selfpres_Default","Did you hear that? "
"Conjuration_SorakFight5_Sellsword_Default","The sound of killing."
"Conjuration_SorakFight6_Starter_Default","The Soraks."
"Conjuration_SorakFight7_Selfpres_Default","That was fast."
"Conjuration_SorakFight8_Sellsword_Default","You afraid?"

"DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_14_Lawkeeper_Default","Is he wanted by the law?"
"DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_15_Noble_NPC","Not by Principality's law."
"DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_16_Noble_NPC","But in the Duchy of Northern plains, he surely is."

"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_11_NOAUDIO_Acolyte","Do you pray to Misaye?"
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_12_Acolyte_Default","Is that a lady of luck tatoo you've got there?"
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_13_Rogue_NPC","Just a mercenary thing."
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_14_Acolyte_Default","There's no shame in worship."
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_15_Rogue_NPC","Are you done?"
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_16_Acolyte_Default","Scholars and Academics rarely worship the goddess of Mischief, that's all."
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_17_Rogue_NPC","I wasn't always a scholar."
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_18_Rogue_NPC","Otherwise I wouldn't be here."
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_19_Acolyte_Default","You mean, you can fight, right?"
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_20_Rogue_NPC","Better than the other six who died on the way here."
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_21_Rogue_NPC","Stay in the light."
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_22_NOAUDIO_Defaulter","Instead you almost got killed"
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_23_Any_Default","Instead you got attacked by orcs."
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_24_Rogue_NPC","As you can see, I'm still standing."
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_25_NOAUDIO_Deception","You'll get a rebate"
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_26_Deceiver_Default","Actually, Galar offers a rebate for Council agents."
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_27_Rogue_NPC","Really? Fine, I'll check out the wares."
"DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_28_Rogue_NPC","So that it's just the regular prices? No thanks."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_1_Galar_NPC","Ah, you're here."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_2_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Master Goldentongue tells me you're good people."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_3_HeliaFairblade_NPC","As you know, I'm shorted handed with my expedition."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_4_Starter_Default","Lost six, we heard."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_5_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Unfortunate."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_6_HeliaFairblade_NPC","If you agree to join my search party, you'll get a handsome pay."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_7_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Five gold pieces a day, each."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_8_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Twenty-five upfront."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_9_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I need Marin Ving found, he once was here."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_10_HeliaFairblade_NPC","It's been a long time, but if we're thorough, we can find his tracks."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_11_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA","Alright"
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_12_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB","Thirty upfront"
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_13_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC","Equipment instead of gold"
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_14_ChoiceA_Default","We have a deal."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_15_ChoiceB_Default","Let's settle for thirty-five gold pieces right now."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_16_ChoiceC_Default","Gold is no use to us now, we need better equipment."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_17_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Excellent."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_18_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I moved the barrier away."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_19_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I believe this is a good way to start."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_20_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I see Galar taught you well. "
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_21_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Fine, thirty-five."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_22_Starter_Default","Thanks."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_23_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Thirty, last chance."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_24_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I don't have much, but our fallen comrades left us some items."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_25_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA","Two healing potions"
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_26_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB","Dust of dissapeance"
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_27_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC","Basic poison"
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_28_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD","Take the gold"
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_29_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Considering your action…I have my doubts."
"DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_30_HeliaFairblade_NPC","But right now, I don't have much choice."
"DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS011_Starter_Default","Look at this."
"DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS012_Partner_Default","Someone made a fire here."
"DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS013_Reactor_Default","That someone wanted to take a sleep but had to go in a rush?"
"DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS014_Commentator_Default","Did you hear that?"
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook1_HeliaFairblade_NPC","So, what do you have for me?"
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook2_Starter_Angry","We found an abandoned camp."
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook3_Starter_Angry","And this."
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook4_HeliaFairblade_NPC","This belongs to Marin Ving."
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook5_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Excellent work."
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook6_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Take a rest, we'll search the area carefully in the morning."
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook7_HeliaFairblade_NPC","We need to know where he went."
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook8_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Team-up with my people if you like."
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook9_HeliaFairblade_NPC","Master Goldentongue wants to talk to you, by the way."
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook10_HeliaFairblade_NPC","I advise you to make amends."
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook11_Mean_Slang","Bugger off."
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook12_Anyother_Normal","We don't need a lecture."
"DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook13_HeliaFairblade_NPC","As promised, your reward."
"DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest1_Rogue_NPC","Looks like you brought me some."
"DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest2_Starter_Default","Multiple items, actually, they seem connected."
"DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest3_Rogue_NPC","By all the gods…"
"DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest4_Rogue_NPC","Thanks a lot, this is going to make my day!"
"DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest5_Rogue_NPC","Here, take this, I have no use for it, but maybe you will…"
"DLC1_Marches_Trapped_1_Player_Default","Wait…redeemers?"
"DLC1_Marches_Trapped_2_Player_Default","We don't stand a chance!"
"DLC1_Marches_Trapped_3_Player_Default","Maybe we can find a way around and return to the camp."
"DLC1_Marches_Trapped_4_Player_Default","This place is a…nest, or something."
"DLC1_Marches_Trapped_5_Player_Default","We can't go back."
"DLC1_Marches_Trapped_6_Player_Default","Looks like our friend VIP suffered the same predicament."
"DLC1_Marches_Trapped_7_Player_Default","There's no choice, we have to move forward."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_Basic","Yes, yes, I'll check your wares."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_Waiting","Anything new?"
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_QuestDone","You did well."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_Angry","There is only one rule : don't get caught."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Basic","Sorry, I really need to catch my breath."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Waiting","Tell me if you find anything of interest."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Happy","Those artifacts you brought me are very interesting."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Basic","Those orcs almost killed us all."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Waiting","I'm sharpening my blade."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Angry","Where I come from, we cut the hands of thieves."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Basic","Speak to Lady Fairblade, I'm resting."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Waiting","Find me Ving, I'll reward you."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Angry","I knew you were just scum."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Galar_Angry","I can't have thieves working for me."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Recruit","If you're after Ving, I'm in."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Recruit","Sure, let's do this."
"DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Recruit","Why not, I'll tag along."
"DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions1_WRITTEN_ChoiceA","Ask companions to stay"
"DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions2_WRITTEN_ChoiceB","Never mind."
"DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions3_ChoiceA_Default","We'd like to continue on our own, for now."
"DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions4_ChoiceB_Default","It's nothing, sorry."
"Background_Quest_Wanderer1_Wanderer_Default","Hey TBC NPC, how are you ?"
"Background_Quest_Wanderer2_HalfOrc_NPC","I need you help in there."
"Background_Quest_Wanderer3_Wanderer_Default","The mine ?"
"Background_Quest_Wanderer4_HalfOrc_NPC","I know who attacked our settlement, back there."
"Background_Quest_Wanderer5_HalfOrc_NPC","I trapped them into a part of the mines."
"Background_Quest_Wanderer6_HalfOrc_NPC","I asked the Baron, he agreed to open it for me, if you come with me."
"Background_Quest_Wanderer7_Wanderer_Default","Sure, let's kill those bastards."
"DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_1_Starter_Default","We're out!"
"DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_2_Partner_Default","This place is a redeemer's nest!"
"DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_3_Reactor_Default","How are we going to go back to the camp?"
"DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_4_Commentator_Default","We can't. "
"DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_5_Starter_Default","On the other hand…I think Marin Ving went that way, too."
"DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_6_Starter_Default","See?"
