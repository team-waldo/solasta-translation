"Background/&KS_GarradMilesBackground_Description","An orphan from the streets of Caer Cyflen, Garrad survived thanks to a little luck and a lot of stubbornness.
He began as an apprentice cutpurse for the Thieves' Guild, but when he grew too big and too noticeable to melt into the crowds with a score, his masters decided that he would make a good crippled beggar.

Unwilling to be maimed for the profit of others, he fled the Guild and the city by enlisting in the army.
After a couple of years at a border fort near the Kingdom of Gallivan, Garrad hired himself out to merchants as a caravan guard, and spent time in several mercenary ""free companies,"" raiding the Marches in the name of one noble or another. Based on his past experience, he dislikes thieves and their guilds, and shows no mercy to any underworld figures who cross him. 

As the Principality began looking for adventurers, Garrad returned to answer the call. More than anything, he hopes that one dark night, in some quiet alley, he will meet the sadistic guildmaster who planned to maim him for profit.

"Background/&KS_RhuadSwiftHandBackground_Description","Rhuad always had a glib tongue and a swift hand, but one day he picked the wrong pocket. 
Under the laws of the Principality he could have suffered a number of harsh punishments, but instead the mage who caught him red-handed - a fellow sylvan elf - sent him to the Treasurer's office for training.

Thus the Principality gained a swift, stealthy, and cunning spy whose greed is kept in check by the knowledge - and by regular reminders from his masters - that any transgression will lead to the swift and inevitable punishment for his original crime.
Rhuad remains a loyal agent of the Principality. He harbors a deep-seated hatred of the New Empire, where he began his life as a slave."

"Background/&KS_VigdisKaikonnenBackground_Description","Vigdis is the youngest daughter of Kaikkonen Vartija, the current head of the powerful Kaikkonen border clan in the Snow Alliance.
Since girlhood she was known for her stubbornness and her strong sense of right and wrong. When she learned that her family planned to marry her into an allied clan for diplomatic reasons she left the Snow Alliance, one step ahead of a posse of brothers and cousins sent to recover her. 
Reaching the Principality of Masgarth, she sought sanctuary at the great temple of Einar, refusing to leave despite all remonstrations. Her father, the Kaikkonen himself, traveled to the temple in an unprecedented attempt at reconciliation, but she refused to be persuaded into the political match. Instead, she entered her novitiate in the service of Einar.
While her family did not formally disown her, it is generally considered unwise to mention her name in their presence. Surprising everyone but herself, Vigdis excelled during her novitiate: offered her choice of service as a reward, she chose to join the wandering Order of the Beacon. Since then she has traveled widely, bringing the light of Einar to all in need and fighting and bleeding for them when necessary.
Even though she treats all as equals and never puts on airs, her accent and choice of words betray a noble background and a good education, as well as a certain familiarity in dealing with powerful people. Vigdis is a hardy dwarf and a true follower of Einar, and her lifestyle in the Order of the Beacon matches her temperament perfectly.

"Background/&KS_VioletGoodCheerBackground_Description","Violet is an unusual marsh halfling. Instead of staying safely at home in the reeds, her wanderlust has carried her far away, to the principality of Masgarth. 
To make things worse, instead of following the good and sensible path of the marsh mage that originated among her people, she has chosen to become a showy, destructive shock arcanist! 
Her family is mortified. Some of their neighbors whisper that the Good-Cheers have a trace of wild island halfling blood, and have never been sensibleâ€¦ though they are careful never to do so when they can be overheard.
Violet is an idealist, and believes that it is better to be out in the world seeing things and doing good, rather than sitting grumpily in a swamp. 
She sees herself as the first of many Marsh Halfling heroes - well, mostly heroines, as she sees it - who will make the world a better place and win renown for themselves and their people. Her personal philosophy is based on freedom and personal accountability for one's actions.
