"Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content","It has now been one week since we were transported to this wretched place! I think the gods have abandoned us! Of our monastery, the only building missing is the temple and its two resident priests! In its place, we have this weird construction, just out of reach of the pier, which we can't even enter. 

All the survivors are scared. They are turning to me for comforting words, but I am only a novice, not yet ready to be a priest. Like them, I am a refugee who fled Sorr-Tarr and his vile servant.

I do not know where we are, but we are far from home. Our little valley is a small pocket of Tirmar, lost - I don't know where!"
"Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content2","Strange beasts roam the night, but for some reason they do not dare to enter our valley.

I buried my daughter last night. She died as much from despair as from the rockslide and the earthquake. Now, I wait for my own end.

Traveler - if you read this, say a prayer for our souls, for I cannot. I reject the gods whose folly brought us here! I curse them all!

The beasts have grown bolder, but they still avoid our valley. A pity, since I could use the meat. I am surviving on grain and vegetables, but solitude makes for hard labor and my strength is not what it was."
"Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content3","It has been 40 years. I am the last one, an old man now! I buried them all - all! But I could not bring myself to give the last rites. No - the gods left us to rot here, and I refused to send our souls back to them!

I have not had word of you since our desperate exodus to this dreadful world. My thoughts are with you, and I hope we will be reunited one day and live in peace at last.
We hoped for a friendly and peaceful world, far from the reach of the Enemy, but alas, we have found only fresh enemies, and our seers tell me that the Sorr-Akkath are not far behind. The war is not over, and we must also face these Manacalons.
They wield magic as potent as that of any priest, yet the High Priest assures us that there are no gods in this world.
These are dark times, and they will test us, but this world is our last hope.
May the Lord of Valor watch over you, my love.
Artus"

"Equipment/&HectorLetterContent1","It was a bad plan; I said so from the start. It took me a month to master Griff's full appearance and a year to build the spider cult. The orcs are now loyal to me and eager to follow me to war, but the Scavengers have found the city and started encroaching on the orcs' territory. I decided to use the orcs ahead of schedule and wipe out the Scavengers. There were only a dozen of them, but they put up more of a fight than I expected, and I had to change the plan again. I sacrificed more orcs to capture their leader, a man named Hector. I will cancel the operation with the spider cult, and take the appearance of this Hector. A prominent member of the Scavengers could be useful. I must spend time alone with him deeper in the ruins, where the orcs don't go."

The mission is a complete failure and I will answer to the Tshar - if I survive. I will try to escape by climbing up the amphitheater, but the spiders might be too fast for me. Glory to Sorr-Tarr!"

Presumably built to pacify the surrounding area."
"Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content03","Later, same day. My initial impression confirmed: the castle is occupied. I encountered a patrol of skeletons led by a wraith who gave his name as Adam the Twelfth, a former Imperial officer and now captain of the castle's guard. He questioned me closely and gave me permission to research outside the castle, but not to approach the castle or try to enter. The lord, whose name he gave as Mardracht, does not receive visitors. Indeed, the captain admitted that he himself had not seen or spoken with his master in several centuries."

"Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content01","On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods, and Its Particular Implications for Necromancy. By Alithariel Threanin, Postulant Junior Master of the Arcaneum, School of Necromancy. Academic Session of 3044, Imperial Calendar"
"Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content02","As my thesis in support of my candidacy for the rank of Junior Master of the Arcaneum at the School of Necromancy, I respectfully submit the results of my research into the nature and types of new magics brought to Solasta by the humans of Tirmar, in particular the effectiveness of those whom they call ""clerics"" in repelling and destroying undead creatures. This knowledge is of urgent importance as we struggle to understand these humans, and assess both the severity of the threat they may post to the Empire and the potential benefit they could bring to it once conquered."
"Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content03","It is widely known that the magic of humans derives from the entities they call ""gods"" (""goddesses"" in the feminine, and ""deities"" collectively). I call it ""divine magic"" in this thesis, to distinguish it from our own arcane magic that is the result of magical study. Just as arcane magic is organized into schools, some divine magic is comprised of eight areas of study, which the humans call ""domains."" Each deity typically provides its clerics with access to two domains, representing its particular interests. The domain that corresponds most closely to the School of Necromancy is called the Domain of Oblivion."
"Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content04","In addition to spells from two domains, a cleric has access to a wide array of other spells and powers, which are common to all regardless of their patron deity. Many are broadly similar in their effects to the spells of the School of Necromancy. There are two necromantic powers, though, that are completely new and unique: a cleric of any Tirmarian deity, if their rank is high enough, can repel undead creatures and even destroy them. The humans I have questioned believe that this is because their deities regard all undead creatures as ""unnatural"" - a word that reveals much about their primitive level of sophistication - and therefore undesirable, but they seem to know nothing about the means by which this result is achieved, speaking only about the ""will"" or ""power"" of their deities."
"Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content05","The following pages examine the phenomenon of ""turning"" and destroying undead using both the classical thaumatological approach of Fathirien and her successors, and the more modern methods championed by Gorlindrien and the Practicalists. All conclusions are tentative. If this thesis is accepted, I propose to make this phenomenon my primary research topic."

"Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content01","…as the Soraks followed humanity, a high priest of Oblivion succumbed to despair and madness. He tainted the peace of the grave with the uncleanliness of undeath, raising the fallen to muster an army. As he knew this was not a prayer that would gain the favor of Maraike, the lady of life and death, he and his followers couched their plan in the form of a curse instead, tricking their goddess into ensuring that their plan would succeed. Maraike granted their plea, but was not deceived. She cursed the conspirators as well, for they had been corrupted by evil and were denied her grace. They became the fallen, and those they raised from death became sorrow zombies, named after the curse of sorrow that they had wrought."
"Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content02","Maraike's punishment ensured that none of the fallen could enjoy the touch of light without suffering and dying. They must forever skulk in the shadows until they repented. But Maraike's punishment was not all. Sorr-Tarr, the vile god of the Soraks, saw potential in the fallen. Without undoing Maraike's curse, he gave them powers to do evil: to corrupt others by their touch, and to create fouler servants than zombies. Of the original fallen not much is known, save that there were twelve of them, priests and paladins…"

"Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Content02","The Governor received them with the appearance of kindness, reasoning that if they came as supplicant fugitives it would be an easy task to subdue them, and either set them to work as slaves alongside the inferior races of Solasta or bind them over to the wizards of the Arcaneum for dissection or whatever other form of study might prove most fruitful. When the guards sought to bind the humans, though, they called upon beings they called ""gods,"" and manifested powerful magics that took their hosts by surprise. Thus they were able to escape."

""Good"" deities are those whom the humans see as helpful to them, and - in their theology at least - concerned with their welfare. ""Evil"" deities are those who are hostile to humans and support the efforts of other races to conquer them. It was an ""evil"" deity and his followers - one Sorr-Tarr and the race of the Sorr-Akkath, or Soraks - who drove the humans to try to escape their home world of Tirmar, they say.

They lived in the mountains, close to volcanoes which they loved for their heat - for nothing else was hot enough to incubate a dragon's egg. At that time the dwarves had not yet come up from below ground, being more rock than flesh, and the halflings remained in their swamps, far from anyone. And what of the elves? The elves were in and of the air, without physical form but existing as swirling currents of air and mana, one with magic and with the world."
"Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content02","Eventually, however, the elves tired of a life of pure spirit and wind.

"Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content02","The dragons fell in love with the elves, as all do who see them. They longed to possess them, for dragons are avaricious by nature.

"Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Content02","The human ancestors of the orcs were members of wild barbarian tribes from the more remote parts of Tirmar. Ferocity and courage in battle were the highest values in their culture, so when the forces of our two worlds combined at the Battle of the Rift, it was these tribes who sought out the most dangerous locations in order to win the most glory by the values of their culture. This brought them very close to the Rift itself, and therefore made them most vulnerable to the unpredictable magical energies that flared out from it. All of those who fought beside them perished, even the elite of the Iron Legions - but somehow these barbarians, strong of mind and strong of body, were able to survive. However, their bodies and minds were both affected, and they became the first orcs to exist in both worlds."

Memories of a Shadow Tamer
By A. Merton
1022 A.C.

They were only a handful of brave explorers, the first ever since the Fall, to cross the mountains to the Old Empire. Their names: Khay, Annie, Betty, Arwin, Swen, Rhianna, and Hector.
Together, they were stronger than all the monsters of the Badlands.
Long before the Copperhead Road was found, they knew the paths and tunnels from Masgarth to Manacalon.
They brought back an old book with teachings of how to enchant primed weapons, and sold it to a dwarf lord of the Gormsdottir clan. That was the start of it all. Soon, all eyes turned to the Badlands. The thirst for the forgotten secrets of the Old Empire was growing.

The rest is scribbled."
