"Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content","It has now been one week since we were transported to this wretched place! I think the gods have abandoned us! Of our monastery, the only building missing is the temple and its two resident priests! In its place, we have this weird construction, just out of reach of the pier, which we can't even enter. 

All the survivors are scared. They are turning to me for comforting words, but I am only a novice, not yet ready to be a priest. Like them, I am a refugee who fled Sorr-Tarr and his vile servant.

I do not know where we are, but we are far from home. Our little valley is a small pocket of Tirmar, lost - I don't know where!"
"Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content2","Strange beasts roam the night, but for some reason they do not dare to enter our valley.

I buried my daughter last night. She died as much from despair as from the rockslide and the earthquake. Now, I wait for my own end.

Traveler - if you read this, say a prayer for our souls, for I cannot. I reject the gods whose folly brought us here! I curse them all!

The beasts have grown bolder, but they still avoid our valley. A pity, since I could use the meat. I am surviving on grain and vegetables, but solitude makes for hard labor and my strength is not what it was."
"Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content3","It has been 40 years. I am the last one, an old man now! I buried them all - all! But I could not bring myself to give the last rites. No - the gods left us to rot here, and I refused to send our souls back to them!

I have not had word of you since our desperate exodus to this dreadful world. My thoughts are with you, and I hope we will be reunited one day and live in peace at last.
We hoped for a friendly and peaceful world, far from the reach of the Enemy, but alas, we have found only fresh enemies, and our seers tell me that the Sorr-Akkath are not far behind. The war is not over, and we must also face these Manacalons.
They wield magic as potent as that of any priest, yet the High Priest assures us that there are no gods in this world.
These are dark times, and they will test us, but this world is our last hope.
May the Lord of Valor watch over you, my love.
Artus"

Alas, our troops are massing to besiege the Rift and stop the enemy once and for all. I am ready for my first magical weapon, a gift for my Lady Karyn. She is already a formidable fighter, but with the blade Laerin will enchant, she will be even more so.

"HectorLetterContent1","It was a bad plan; I said so from the start. It took me a month to master Griff's full appearance and a year to build the spider cult. The orcs are now loyal to me and eager to follow me to war, but the Scavengers have found the city and started encroaching on the orcs' territory. I decided to use the orcs ahead of schedule and wipe out the Scavengers. There were only a dozen of them, but they put up more of a fight than I expected, and I had to change the plan again. I sacrificed more orcs to capture their leader, a man named Hector. I will cancel the operation with the spider cult, and take the appearance of this Hector. A prominent member of the Scavengers could be useful. I must spend time alone with him deeper in the ruins, where the orcs don't go."

The mission is a complete failure and I will answer to the Tshar - if I survive. I will try to escape by climbing up the amphitheater, but the spiders might be too fast for me. Glory to Sorr-Tarr!"

A standard founding plaque: ""Caer Tenarion"", built by the 25th Iron Legion in the 24th year of Gwaltrian the Third - year 1557 in the Manacalon calendar, or 1486 before the Cataclysm. Presumably built to pacify the surrounding area."
"Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content03","Later, same day. My initial impression confirmed: the castle is occupied. I encountered a patrol of skeletons led by a wraith who gave his name as Adam the Twelfth, a former Imperial officer and now captain of the castle's guard. He questioned me closely and gave me permission to research outside the castle, but not to approach the castle or try to enter. The lord, whose name he gave as Mardracht, does not receive visitors. Indeed, the captain admitted that he himself had not seen or spoken with his master in several centuries."
"Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content04","Graveyard, continued …no gravestone shows a burial date later than the Cataclysm: no new burials in more than a thousand years. Possibly all in the castle are undead, like their guards. Impossible to confirm since I am refused admission."

"Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content06","The following day, continued …as I continued to document the graveyard, a pack of wolves arrived from the north, led by a human man - or so he seemed. Met by captain and guards. Conversed for several minutes, manner guarded but not unfriendly. The captain pointed in my direction, clearly informing the man of my presence. No one in the group showed any interest in me."
"Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content07","Later, same day: An elven woman came out of the mausoleum, accompanied by several others: elves and humans, all apparently alive. They could not have entered the mausoleum without my seeing them. Two questions arise:"

"Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content09","2. Living souls in the castle, yet no burials newer than 1,000 years? Two possibilities: life magically prolonged (necromancy? Fits with undead guard I encountered) and/or bodies not buried upon death (also compatible with necromancy)."

"Necromancy_Thesis_Content01","On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods, and Its Particular Implications for Necromancy. By Alithariel Threanin, Postulant Junior Master of the Arcaneum, School of Necromancy. Academic Session of 3044, Imperial Calendar"
"Necromancy_Thesis_Content02","As my thesis in support of my candidacy for the rank of Junior Master of the Arcaneum at the School of Necromancy, I respectfully submit the results of my research into the nature and types of new magics brought to Solasta by the humans of Tirmar, in particular the effectiveness of those whom they call ""clerics"" in repelling and destroying undead creatures. This knowledge is of urgent importance as we struggle to understand these humans, and assess both the severity of the threat they may post to the Empire and the potential benefit they could bring to it once conquered."
"Necromancy_Thesis_Content03","It is widely known that the magic of humans derives from the entities they call ""gods"" (""goddesses"" in the feminine, and ""deities"" collectively). I call it ""divine magic"" in this thesis, to distinguish it from our own arcane magic that is the result of magical study. Just as arcane magic is organized into schools, some divine magic is comprised of eight areas of study, which the humans call ""domains."" Each deity typically provides its clerics with access to two domains, representing its particular interests. The domain that corresponds most closely to the School of Necromancy is called the Domain of Oblivion."
"Necromancy_Thesis_Content04","In addition to spells from two domains, a cleric has access to a wide array of other spells and powers, which are common to all regardless of their patron deity. Many are broadly similar in their effects to the spells of the School of Necromancy. There are two necromantic powers, though, that are completely new and unique: a cleric of any Tirmarian deity, if their rank is high enough, can repel undead creatures and even destroy them. The humans I have questioned believe that this is because their deities regard all undead creatures as ""unnatural"" - a word that reveals much about their primitive level of sophistication - and therefore undesirable, but they seem to know nothing about the means by which this result is achieved, speaking only about the ""will"" or ""power"" of their deities."
"Necromancy_Thesis_Content05","The following pages examine the phenomenon of ""turning"" and destroying undead using both the classical thaumatological approach of Fathirien and her successors, and the more modern methods championed by Gorlindrien and the Practicalists. All conclusions are tentative. If this thesis is accepted, I propose to make this phenomenon my primary research topic."

"Necromancy_Fallen_Content01","…as the Soraks followed humanity, a high priest of Oblivion succumbed to despair and madness. He tainted the peace of the grave with the uncleanliness of undeath, raising the fallen to muster an army. As he knew this was not a prayer that would gain the favor of Maraike, the lady of life and death, he and his followers couched their plan in the form of a curse instead, tricking their goddess into ensuring that their plan would succeed. Maraike granted their plea, but was not deceived. She cursed the conspirators as well, for they had been corrupted by evil and were denied her grace. They became the fallen, and those they raised from death became sorrow zombies, named after the curse of sorrow that they had wrought."
"Necromancy_Fallen_Content02","Maraike's punishment ensured that none of the fallen could enjoy the touch of light without suffering and dying. They must forever skulk in the shadows until they repented. But Maraike's punishment was not all. Sorr-Tarr, the vile god of the Soraks, saw potential in the fallen. Without undoing Maraike's curse, he gave them powers to do evil: to corrupt others by their touch, and to create fouler servants than zombies. Of the original fallen not much is known, save that there were twelve of them, priests and paladins…"

"Necromancy_Refugees_Content02","The Governor received them with the appearance of kindness, reasoning that if they came as supplicant fugitives it would be an easy task to subdue them, and either set them to work as slaves alongside the inferior races of Solasta or bind them over to the wizards of the Arcaneum for dissection or whatever other form of study might prove most fruitful.

""Good"" deities are those whom the humans see as helpful to them, and - in their theology at least - concerned with their welfare. ""Evil"" deities are those who are hostile to humans and support the efforts of other races to conquer them.

"Abjuration_Dragons_Content01","There was a time, very long ago, when dragons were the rulers of Solasta. They lived in the mountains, close to volcanoes which they loved for their heat - for nothing else was hot enough to incubate a dragon's egg. At that time the dwarves had not yet come up from below ground, being more rock than flesh, and the halflings remained in their swamps, far from anyone. And what of the elves? The elves were in and of the air, without physical form but existing as swirling currents of air and mana, one with magic and with the world."
"Abjuration_Dragons_Content02","Eventually, however, the elves tired of a life of pure spirit and wind. They took a physical form and began to build great spires and palaces, bringing the beauty of their thoughts into material being.

"Abjuration_Housekeeping_Content02","Remember that no matter how intelligent and endearing they may seem, your non-elf slaves are animals, nothing more. Do not indulge them, but give them every day a new reason to fear your wrath and a fresh reminder that your power is absolute.

They had never seen beauty before, nor heard music; their language was devoid of poetry, and their magic was brutal and without wonder."
"Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content02","The dragons fell in love with the elves, as all do who see them. They longed to possess them, for dragons are avaricious by nature. With sweet words and trickery they enslaved a few of the fair people, but most elves were not taken in by the dragons' flattery, and prepared to resist them."
"Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content03","Great battles were fought, blade against flame, and magic against magic. Mountains were leveled, and land sank to make the Inner Sea. The tunnels where the dwarves hid in fear were flooded.

"Illusion_Book1_Content01","…as Master Irillien of the Arcaneum wrote in his great work ""On the Nature of Illusion and the Question of Reality,"" ""Many illusions, if believed, are as effective as if they were real; conversely, some realities, if ignored, may be avoided. Which, then, is more valid? What, indeed, is real, or reality? Was our great Empire, and our rightful mastery of the world and all who dwell therein, not a dream, which is a form of illusion, before our Iron Legions and our arcanists made it real?"""
"Illusion_Book1_Content02","There is some merit, therefore, in avoiding a distinction between illusion and reality, but regarding them instead as two poles of a continuum. Some things are entirely real, and some things are entirely illusory, but the numbers of each are far fewer than is commonly supposed. Most things lie somewhere in between, partaking of the natures of illusion and reality in differing proportions. Those who seek a true understanding of the nature of things, and the distinctions…"

"Illusion_Book2_Description","A book written in high elvish."
"Illusion_Book2_Content01","…exploration of the planes outside our own revealed the existence of all manner of strange entities, some of them exceptionally powerful. It is to be supposed that the world of Tirmar, from which the humans came with their gods, belongs in one of these planes, which somehow collided with our own during the events leading up to the Cataclysm, instead of remaining safely confined beyond a magical portal."
"Illusion_Book2_Content02","The reason for this is unknown. Several theories have been put forward, but none has been proven. Although they vary in their finer details, many theories blame the deity Sorr-Tarr, from whom the humans and their gods were fleeing as they entered Solasta. The scholars of the Arcaneum do not fully understand the class of beings called ""gods"" or ""deities,"" and while their human followers proudly assert that their powers are without limit, it is clear that this cannot be the case, or the Cataclysm would have been prevented. Still, this Sorr-Tarr, being a powerful entity of this class, might have sought to open the Rift wider, in order to facilitate the pursuit by his Sorr-Akkath followers and complete…"

Human accounts of the matter are confused and often contradict each other, but a careful reading of the best sources suggests that the orcs were once human, and were altered by the wild magics that accompanied the closing of the Rift."
"Illusion_Book3_Content02","The human ancestors of the orcs were members of wild barbarian tribes from the more remote parts of Tirmar. Ferocity and courage in battle were the highest values in their culture, so when the forces of our two worlds combined at the Battle of the Rift, it was these tribes who sought out the most dangerous locations in order to win the most glory by the values of their culture. This brought them very close to the Rift itself, and therefore made them most vulnerable to the unpredictable magical energies that flared out from it. All of those who fought beside them perished, even the elite of the Iron Legions - but somehow these barbarians, strong of mind and strong of body, were able to survive. However, their bodies and minds were both affected, and they became the first orcs to exist in both worlds."

Memories of a Shadow Tamer
By A. Merton
1022 A.C.

They were only a handful of brave explorers, the first ever since the Fall, to cross the mountains to the Old Empire. Their names: Khay, Annie, Betty, Arwin, Swen, Rhianna, and Hector.
Together, they were stronger than all the monsters of the Badlands.
Long before the Copperhead Road was found, they knew the paths and tunnels from Masgarth to Manacalon.
They brought back an old book with teachings of how to enchant primed weapons, and sold it to a dwarf lord of the Gormsdottir clan. That was the start of it all. Soon, all eyes turned to the Badlands. The thirst for the forgotten secrets of the Old Empire was growing.

The rest is scribbled."
