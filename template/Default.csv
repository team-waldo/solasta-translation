"Deity/&ArunDescription","The primordial god of the elements and patron of adventurers, peasants, hermits, and all others who value nature above civilization.
The oldest of the Tirmarian deities, Arun is the one to whom humanity first prayed while struggling to survive in a hostile environment. His spouse is Maraike, the goddess of life and death.
His clergy is divided into three main branches, each attached to one of Arun's powers: fire, ice, and lightning."

"Deity/&EinarDescription","Einar is the god of valor and fidelity, and the patron of paladins, lawful warriors, and all those who bring light to darkness. The Church of Einar is organized into three Orders: 
The Blade is a militant order, a bulwark against chaos and evil.
The Shield is an order of protectors, devoted to their flock.
The Beacon is an order of itinerant preachers, helping the communities through which they travel with their strength at arms, their healing skills, and their knowledge of the law."

"Deity/&MaraikeDescription","The goddess of life and death, the patron of healers and embalmers, and the embodiment of universal duality. Traditionally, she is Arun's wife. Her cult consists of two orders:
The Order of Life Regnant travels the land as healers and defenders. They worship the healing, motherly aspect of Maraike.
The Order of Oblivion is an order of avengers and embalmers. Where evil tries to pervert the cycle of life and death, the Order ensures that the culprits are dealt with, and their undead victims returned to their rest. "

"Deity/&MisayeDescription","The goddess of mischief, protector of rogues and swindlers, and patron of all those who chafe against rules and enjoy a little chaos. 
Priests of Misaye seldom live a relaxing life. Usually, they are one step ahead of the law - if they are lucky! Many lead a double life - normal citizens by day and priests of Misaye by night - because the cult of Misaye is outlawed in many nations and barely tolerated in most others."
"Deity/&MisayeTitle","Misaye"
"Deity/&PakriDescription","The goddess of law and knowledge and patron of judges and lawyers, teachers, librarians, and scholars.
She gifted humans with the thirst for knowledge so they could learn and develop their society, and the law which preserves civilization.

The Order of the Owl sends its members across the land to help those in need of protection and justice."

Be sure that OUR team is currently working hard to bring the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game to a whole new level. The PRE-ALPHA DEMO is made available for free for a limited period of time only. 

The PRE-ALPHA DEMO is hand-crafted to give YOU an early taste of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game; the PRE-ALPHA DEMO may contain bugs on rare occasions. YOU are more than welcome to share your feedback and report any problems or bugs on the Steam platform or directly on OUR website www.solasta-game.com. WE need to hear from YOU in order to make a game that is representative of what our community wants.

Some rules and features are missing or are not implemented in the PRE-ALPHA DEMO. For example, the surprise round is not implemented, readying an action is not yet possible, we are too liberal at swapping inventory items, and some spells and effects are missing. We will fix this and try our best to integrate as much content and as many rules as possible for the final game. Some of the game features are also not demonstrated at all in the PRE-ALPHA DEMO but will be part of the final game: creating and leveling up a full party with a wide range of options, playing through a campaign storyline, and much more."

"Legal/&EarlyAccessDisclaimerDescription","Hey there folks! Welcome to Solasta - or more specifically, the Early Access of Solasta: Crown of the Magister. We really appreciate your support. You're all fantastic!

Please bear in mind that you are playing an Early Access version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister which is still under development. This Early Access version contains around 10 hours of gameplay and gives you access to the full Character Creation Tool with all ancestries, classes, and archetypes unlocked, with a level cap at level 6. The full 1.0 release will see a price increase and will deliver the entire main campaign of Solasta: Crown of the Magister, as well as many side quests for you to discover. 

We have done our best to provide a strong and enjoyable experience. However, do note that the Early Access version may contain some occasional bugs. You are warmly invited to send us feedback, report any bugs and problems, or suggest improvements on our Discord server (https://discord.com/invite/uu8utaF) as well on our official forums (https://forums.solasta-game.com/). Our goal is to continue working hand in hand with our players to make a game that is representative of what our community wants. Be sure that our team is currently working hard to release the full version of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game that will include lots of additional features and content. 

Considering the fact that game development is a very iterative process, please understand that your save files on the Early Access version will likely be incompatible with larger updates and with the full game release. As such, if you are looking for the complete experience the full version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister can offer, we encourage you not to purchase this Early Access version, but to wait for the release of the full game. Alright, enough reading - go enjoy the game!"
