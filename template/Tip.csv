"Tip/&LoadingTip01","Casting spells consumes spell slots. Most classes regain spell slots after a long rest."
"Tip/&LoadingTip02","When rolling an attack or ability check with advantage, two d20s are rolled and the better result is used. When rolling with disadvantage, the worst result is kept."
"Tip/&LoadingTip03","Open the Journal screen ($Shortcut[PartyJournal]) to consult your party progress, objectives, and achievements."
"Tip/&LoadingTip04","You can customize your 3D dice in the Game Settings."
"Tip/&LoadingTip05","Spells consume spell slots when cast, unlike cantrips which can be cast at will."
"Tip/&LoadingTip06","Taking a long rest is the main way to recover all your spell slots, although wizards can use Arcane Recovery to recover a few low-level slots during short rests."
"Tip/&LoadingTip07","Most spellcasters cannot use all the spells they know. They need to prepare a number of them and take a long rest."
"Tip/&LoadingTip08","Wizards must learn new spells and write them in their spellbook before they can prepare and cast them."
"Tip/&LoadingTip09","Clerics and paladins always know all the spells they can cast at their level, but still need to prepare those they want to be able to cast."
"Tip/&LoadingTip10","Wizard spell scrolls are destroyed after casting. Wizards can also copy a spell from a scroll into their spellbook to acquire them, which also destroys the scroll."
"Tip/&LoadingTip13","Some creatures are afraid of light and can even be hurt by it, allowing you to use light as a weapon."
"Tip/&LoadingTip14","To perform a long rest, you must find a suitable place: either an inn such as the Gravekeep's Cask, or a campfire when exploring."
"Tip/&LoadingTip15","In each turn of battle, a character has a main action and a bonus action. The main action is used to move or attack, for instance, while bonus actions are granted by specific class features, spells, or powers."
"Tip/&LoadingTip16","Reactions allow them to interrupt someone else's action, for instance, to perform an opportunity attack. Each character can make one reaction, and recover it at the start of their next turn."
"Tip/&LoadingTip17","Some characters or monsters can attack more than once per turn, and can move between attacks."
"Tip/&LoadingTip18","Shoving can push an enemy one cell away or put them down until they get up. Enemies can shove, too."
"Tip/&LoadingTip19","Dodging is a powerful defense even if it uses your main action: enemies have disadvantage on hitting you for the remainder of your turn."

"Tip/&LoadingTip21","In combat, you can move normally and then dash as your main action to go twice as far."

"Tip/&LoadingTip23","Most characters can climb two cells without a problem. Climbing higher requires strength, and proficiency with Athletics helps a lot. Some characters, like thieves or darkweavers, have superior climbing abilities."
"Tip/&LoadingTip25","After moving the camera around to examine your surroundings, you can center on a character and follow them. Either double-click the character's portrait or press TAB while controlling this character."
"Tip/&LoadingTip26","To better navigate in three dimensions, activate/deactivate the camera planar mode, with the button in the center of the compass (bottom right of the screen)."
"Tip/&LoadingTip27","Flying spells or artifacts can let you move almost anywhere you want. But losing concentration means falling - possibly to your death."
"Tip/&LoadingTip28","When a battle starts, all creatures involved roll initiative to determine the play order. High dexterity raises your initiative."

"Tip/&LoadingTip30","You can set up weapon slots to change quickly from sword and shield to bow, for example, or to draw a torch along with a one-handed weapon. Prepare any combo you like."
"Tip/&LoadingTip31","Many consumables can be set up in the utility slot, making them available more quickly than the inventory would."

"Tip/&LoadingTip33","Ingredients are various items like flowers, powders, and magic gems, allowing you to craft a variety of items, from healing potions to powerful magic swords."
"Tip/&LoadingTip34","To craft, you need the relevant proficiency. Your ability scores matter, too. For instance, to craft a scroll you need proficiency with the scroll kit, and Arcana will help a lot."
"Tip/&LoadingTip35","Crafting can be performed during downtime while traveling. A character with a crafting operation in progress works on their task before sleeping."
"Tip/&LoadingTip36","Personality flags influence the dialog lines spoken by a character. They don't make choices for you - they simply change the flavor of the experience."

"Tip/&LoadingTip38","Your group has a specific level of relations with each of the game's factions. The more they like you, the more items they will sell you, and the lower their prices will be."
"Tip/&LoadingTip39","When bringing back items from the Badlands, choose which faction to sell them to. This will influence your relations with them."
"Tip/&LoadingTip40","Disengage can be used as a main action, allowing you to move outside the enemies' range without risking opportunity attacks."
"Tip/&LoadingTip41","When an enemy is in a neighboring cell, you are engaged. If you move away from that enemy, you risk suffering an opportunity attack."

"Tip/&LoadingTip44","Wielding a finesse weapon allows you to use Dexterity as the main ability score for the attack, if it is better than Strength. Check for the Finesse tag."
"Tip/&LoadingTip45","A weapon with the Versatile tag can be used with one or two hands. If you leave the second hand slot empty, you'll deal more damage with such a weapon. Example: a longsword."
"Tip/&LoadingTip47","To level up, your characters need to take a long rest. They will gain their new power when waking up."
"Tip/&LoadingTip12","At the edge of your light sources, the environment is in dim light. You don't need Darkvision to see in dim light."
"Tip/&LoadingTip11","Lighting is a crucial element of the game; characters without Darkvision will attack an unlit foe with disadvantage. Use torches and light spells to illuminate your environment."

"Tip/&LoadingTip48","You can change the difficulty settings of the game on the fly at any time."
