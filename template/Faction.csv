One room, face to face, our eyes met.
Art said sloppy as you draw near.
No man has shared you as I have.

Both our hands collide as well as our lips.
The stars find sparks floating around to gasp.

Herald my pounding heart to calm.
He grabbed my beard and kissed my neck.
Pure passion, one beast with two backs.
A gaze to make it all perfect.

I reach for my side, and you are not there.
In the night, I cried for my sweet Garrod.

"Faction/&ItemsScroll04_Description","Tomaz,

I do hope these words find you good health, and I am sorry for not writing sooner. Requisitioning the necessary supplies, and ensuring delivery is risky, and dangerous. But it is well worth it, as your letters have become a shining beacon of hope in the dark nights that haunt this prison.

Your words of concern are not misplaced, as the wound of old is spreading my certain end through my feverish body. Days of labor are more torturous than the last, every disciplinary action leaving wounds that will never heal, and hunger has thinned the veil between reality and dream. I fear this letter may be my last.

Long ago you asked me what crimes lead me here, and I professed my innocence. I could not risk that my beloved thought any less of me. Your worship of my fortitude, determination, and spirit allowed you to draw strength in dark times. I could not allow that to be tainted by my past. But now, in these final days, I understand that I was hardly worthy of that affection. I will never fathom how I deserved meeting you in this crucible of my own making.

When I was young my mother's farm had fallen on hard times. I was sent to the Lady's estate to work as a maid amongst deranged aristocrats. These years were filled with mischievous pranks, brute discipline, and cruel indignities. All of my scars and faults tell of those years. The Lady never burdened herself with guilt, but put the blame solely on the shoulders of my mother. Repressed longings turned into despair, despair into resentment, and resentment into spite, which culminated into a hate-filled second of violence my mother did not survive.

And despite my faults, lies, and my shameful past, you still loved me. I did not fully understand why until the end. You did not need to know my past, for your love is unconditional.

Please, my love, do not look at the past, but to the future. Do not fall for despair as I once did, but let the child birthed of our love carry you to a new beginning.

Merilyn"

"Faction/&ItemsScroll04_Title2","A letter, written in haste on a torn-out scrap of paper."
"Faction/&ItemsScroll05_Description","I, Nilocyrel Dream-Minder, hereby bear witness of the miracle of light.

As part of a conclave of mages focused on the research of magic and accompanied by the always interfering Imperial agents we were to investigate rumors of the sudden appearance of a seemingly magical construct of light deep in an uninhabited region of Aer-Elai. While fast-traveling through still civilized areas of the Empire, we took notice of strange rumors that had started to spread.

Sightings of creatures, burly as dwarves but almost as tall as the Sitherna itself. Clad in pelts and iron, aggressive and savage. At first we thought some children were exaggerating their encounter with the lonely remains of some scattered dwarves, but later on we were able to study a captive, while resting in a rural outpost. Its stature and surly look were comparable with the dwarves from the northern mountains, if it weren't for the obvious difference in size.

Judging by the still wrinkle-free face it was most likely a youngling and seemed to be able to speak, but neither I nor my more traveled companions could make any sense of the guttural sounds it would utter. My colleague Andariel Silvertongue muses if it would be possible to use magic to understand these barbaric humanoids, but we didn't have time to further research this topic. Maybe our misguided brethren in the east might know more about this kin.

Four days after we left the seat of the Arcaneum, while the darkness of the approaching night started to set in, we finally caught a glimpse of the incident we were tasked to research. I saw the sky burn with cold, otherworldly flames, which were of a kind neither of us had laid its eyes upon before.

It is too dark to continue and while a sight to behold, I sense a feeling of dread coming from this light. I entrust this interim report to an accompanying agent, who will travel back this night to report the coordinates this magical construct can be found at. Tomorrow we will advance further."

"Faction/&ItemsScroll06_Description","His name was Thuriel Duskfall.
A childhood disease left him deaf and disfigured.
He found his sole pleasure in life from fishing in the streams at night. Silent and at peace, he was not judged when alone and in the dark. Thus, he developed a skill that gave him value in the eyes of the sylvan elves, who otherwise viewed him as imperfect and damaged.
He was also my brother.
I covered his body with a cairn of stones on the riverbank where I found it.
They had taken his rod and his fish, the bracelet he had from our father, his fileting knife, everything.
So I tracked them. They were many, and arrogant, but I had little else to do, and all the time in the world.
Four died before they learned to leave guards at night.
Two more before they learned to make sure the guards were sober.
Six of them slept together in a tent; I slit the throats of the three largest and left the rest to their sweet dreams.
By the time they made Port Harrow they were telling stories of the hordes of night witches who descended upon them from the haunted boughs of Colthannin, drinking the blood of their friends and depopulating entire villages.
More died there, where they mistakenly believed the crowds would give them safety.
An envoy from my people came, asking me to stop. I indicated that I would do so the day my brother came back to life.
I have not done so.
Stranger, if you find this scroll, by the cairn by the river, I ask that you leave it be, and say a prayer for the soul of my brother.
Stranger, if you find this scroll, by the cairn by the river, and disturb the cairn, or take the scroll, know that I will find you.
They call me Nightplague."

"Faction/&ItemsScroll07_Description","The Dragon's Den - Grand Opening: Come one, come all, join us on the 23rd of May for the Grand Opening of The Dragon's Den - Gallivan's newest tavern, eatery, and bordello. Enjoy one of 10 different ales, or perhaps a vintage cask of wine from our cellar while you enjoy rack of meat and freshly baked bread.

Need to satisfy a hunger of a different kind? Take a look at what we have to offer upstairs. Fancy a stout dwarf to rub out your tensions? We have three to choose from. Prefer something a little pointier with a slender frame? We have you covered with the fairest elven beauties in the land. We even have a halfling if you are into that sort of thing.
In celebration of our Grand Opening, we will also have a very special guest performer from 21:12 until closing time. The famous bard Neil Beart will be giving a rare solo performance, all the way from the Principality.

Other opening day activities include:

Axe throwing hosted by Runglia Silverbeard (yes, we even have a bearded ""lady"")
Tarot reading by Aelrindel the Wise
Battle Chess Tournament
Much, much more!
We are located on the eastern edge of town, just past the town apothecary. And finally, a short poem from Lord Astaroth, a renowned battlemage and our sole proprietor.

Stained velvet, dirty lace,
Naked glee on every face.
Open up to your inner desires,
As you lay here, by the fire.

All are welcome here,
Without worry, regret, or fear.
So pull up a chair and sit up straight,
Some might even say it's fate.

Oh, my beautiful lady,
So fair, slim and shady,
I'll meet you upstairs
After I trim these pesky nose hairs…

In the Dragon's Den

I am sorry my letter will reach you later than expected.
The long wait had the simple reason that there was work to be done.
