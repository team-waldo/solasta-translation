Based on his past experience, he dislikes thieves and their guilds, and shows no mercy to any underworld figures who cross him. \n\nAs the Principality began looking for adventurers, Garrad returned to answer the call.

When she learned that her family planned to marry her into an allied clan for diplomatic reasons she left the Snow Alliance, one step ahead of a posse of brothers and cousins sent to recover her. \nReaching the Principality of Masgarth, she sought sanctuary at the great temple of Einar, refusing to leave despite all remonstrations. Her father, the Kaikkonen himself, traveled to the temple in an unprecedented attempt at reconciliation, but she refused to be persuaded into the political match. Instead, she entered her novitiate in the service of Einar.\nWhile her family did not formally disown her, it is generally considered unwise to mention her name in their presence. Surprising everyone but herself, Vigdis excelled during her novitiate: offered her choice of service as a reward, she chose to join the wandering Order of the Beacon. Since then she has traveled widely, bringing the light of Einar to all in need and fighting and bleeding for them when necessary.\nEven though she treats all as equals and never puts on airs, her accent and choice of words betray a noble background and a good education, as well as a certain familiarity in dealing with powerful people. Vigdis is a hardy dwarf and a true follower of Einar, and her lifestyle in the Order of the Beacon matches her temperament perfectly.\n",

Some of their neighbors whisper that the Good-Cheers have a trace of wild island halfling blood, and have never been sensible… though they are careful never to do so when they can be overheard.\nViolet is an idealist, and believes that it is better to be out in the world seeing things and doing good, rather than sitting grumpily in a swamp. \nShe sees herself as the first of many Marsh Halfling heroes - well, mostly heroines, as she sees it - who will make the world a better place and win renown for themselves and their people.

Requisitioning the necessary supplies, and ensuring delivery is risky, and dangerous. But it is well worth it, as your letters have become a shining beacon of hope in the dark nights that haunt this prison.\n\nYour words of concern are not misplaced, as the wound of old is spreading my certain end through my feverish body. Days of labor are more torturous than the last, every disciplinary action leaving wounds that will never heal, and hunger has thinned the veil between reality and dream. I fear this letter may be my last.\n\nLong ago you asked me what crimes lead me here, and I professed my innocence. I could not risk that my beloved thought any less of me. Your worship of my fortitude, determination, and spirit allowed you to draw strength in dark times. I could not allow that to be tainted by my past. But now, in these final days, I understand that I was hardly worthy of that affection. I will never fathom how I deserved meeting you in this crucible of my own making.\n\nWhen I was young my mother's farm had fallen on hard times. I was sent to the Lady's estate to work as a maid amongst deranged aristocrats. These years were filled with mischievous pranks, brute discipline, and cruel indignities. All of my scars and faults tell of those years. The Lady never burdened herself with guilt, but put the blame solely on the shoulders of my mother. Repressed longings turned into despair, despair into resentment, and resentment into spite, which culminated into a hate-filled second of violence my mother did not survive.\n\nAnd despite my faults, lies, and my shameful past, you still loved me. I did not fully understand why until the end. You did not need to know my past, for your love is unconditional.\n\nPlease, my love, do not look at the past, but to the future. Do not fall for despair as I once did, but let the child birthed of our love carry you to a new beginning.\n\nMerilyn",

While fast-traveling through still civilized areas of the Empire, we took notice of strange rumors that had started to spread.\n\nSightings of creatures, burly as dwarves but almost as tall as the Sitherna itself. Clad in pelts and iron, aggressive and savage. At first we thought some children were exaggerating their encounter with the lonely remains of some scattered dwarves, but later on we were able to study a captive, while resting in a rural outpost. Its stature and surly look were comparable with the dwarves from the northern mountains, if it weren't for the obvious difference in size.\n\nJudging by the still wrinkle-free face it was most likely a youngling and seemed to be able to speak, but neither I nor my more traveled companions could make any sense of the guttural sounds it would utter. My colleague Andariel Silvertongue muses if it would be possible to use magic to understand these barbaric humanoids, but we didn't have time to further research this topic. Maybe our misguided brethren in the east might know more about this kin.\n\nFour days after we left the seat of the Arcaneum, while the darkness of the approaching night started to set in, we finally caught a glimpse of the incident we were tasked to research. I saw the sky burn with cold, otherworldly flames, which were of a kind neither of us had laid its eyes upon before.\n\nIt is too dark to continue and while a sight to behold, I sense a feeling of dread coming from this light.

Be sure that OUR team is currently working hard to bring the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game to a whole new level. The PRE-ALPHA DEMO is made available for free for a limited period of time only. \n\nThe PRE-ALPHA DEMO is hand-crafted to give YOU an early taste of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game; the PRE-ALPHA DEMO may contain bugs on rare occasions. YOU are more than welcome to share your feedback and report any problems or bugs on the Steam platform or directly on OUR website www.solasta-game.com. WE need to hear from YOU in order to make a game that is representative of what our community wants.\n\nSome rules and features are missing or are not implemented in the PRE-ALPHA DEMO. For example, the surprise round is not implemented, readying an action is not yet possible, we are too liberal at swapping inventory items, and some spells and effects are missing. We will fix this and try our best to integrate as much content and as many rules as possible for the final game.

  "Marketing/&DisclaimerSteamFestivalDescription": "You are aware that what you intend to play is a very early Alpha Demo of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game, which is still under development. Be sure that our team is currently working hard to bring Solasta: Crown of the Magister to a whole new level. We are also working on providing you with a fully working Character Creator, allowing you to create and level up a full party with an even wider range of options. The Early Alpha Demo is available for free for a limited period of time only. \n\nThe Early Alpha Demo is hand-crafted to give you an early taste of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game, it may contain bugs on rare occasions. You are more than welcome to share your feedback and report any problems or bugs on the Steam platform or directly on our website www.solasta-game.com. We need to hear from you in order to make a game that is representative of what our community wants.\n\nSome rules and features are missing or are not implemented in the Early Alpha Demo. For example, some spells and effects are missing. The Early Alpha Demo allows you to create a full party of characters using the Character Creator tool, but it will not breathe life into your heroes yet. We will of course fix this and try our best to integrate as much content and rules as possible for the final game. Some of the game features are also not demonstrated at all in the Early Alpha Demo, but will be part of the final game: leveling up a full party created with a wide range of options, playing through a campaign storyline, and much more.\n",

  "Tip/&LoadingTip06": "Taking a long rest is the main way to recover all your spell slots, although wizards can use Arcane Recovery to recover a few low-level slots during short rests.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip07": "Most spellcasters cannot use all the spells they know. They need to prepare a number of them and take a long rest.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip08": "Wizards must learn new spells and write them in their spellbook before they can prepare and cast them.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip09": "Clerics and paladins always know all the spells they can cast at their level, but still need to prepare those they want to be able to cast.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip10": "Wizard spell scrolls are destroyed after casting. Wizards can also copy a spell from a scroll into their spellbook to acquire them, which also destroys the scroll.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip13": "Some creatures are afraid of light and can even be hurt by it, allowing you to use light as a weapon.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip14": "To perform a long rest, you must find a suitable place: either an inn such as the Gravekeep's Cask, or a campfire when exploring.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip15": "In each turn of battle, a character has a main action and a bonus action. The main action is used to move or attack, for instance, while bonus actions are granted by specific class features, spells, or powers.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip16": "Reactions allow them to interrupt someone else's action, for instance, to perform an opportunity attack. Each character can make one reaction, and recover it at the start of their next turn.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip17": "Some characters or monsters can attack more than once per turn, and can move between attacks.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip18": "Shoving can push an enemy one cell away or put them down until they get up. Enemies can shove, too.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip19": "Dodging is a powerful defense even if it uses your main action: enemies have disadvantage on hitting you for the remainder of your turn.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip20": "Switch to cautious mode when exploring. You'll be slow, but better able to notice traps and footsteps.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip21": "In combat, you can move normally and then dash as your main action to go twice as far.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip22": "Most characters can jump two cells without a problem. Longer jumps require strength, and proficiency with Athletics helps a lot. You always have a chance to fall prone when landing if you jump far.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip23": "Most characters can climb two cells without a problem. Climbing higher requires strength, and proficiency with Athletics helps a lot. Some characters, like thieves or darkweavers, have superior climbing abilities.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip25": "After moving the camera around to examine your surroundings, you can center on a character and follow them. Either double-click the character's portrait or press TAB while controlling this character.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip26": "To better navigate in three dimensions, activate/deactivate the camera planar mode, with the button in the center of the compass (bottom right of the screen).",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip27": "Flying spells or artifacts can let you move almost anywhere you want. But losing concentration means falling - possibly to your death.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip28": "When a battle starts, all creatures involved roll initiative to determine the play order. High dexterity raises your initiative.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip29": "Battles sometimes begin with one side being surprised. Surprised characters or creatures cannot act during the first round of battle.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip30": "You can set up weapon slots to change quickly from sword and shield to bow, for example, or to draw a torch along with a one-handed weapon. Prepare any combo you like.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip31": "Many consumables can be set up in the utility slot, making them available more quickly than the inventory would.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip32": "When you find a mysterious item, use Detect Magic first to determine whether it has magical properties. If it does, use Identify to learn how to use it.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip33": "Ingredients are various items like flowers, powders, and magic gems, allowing you to craft a variety of items, from healing potions to powerful magic swords.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip34": "To craft, you need the relevant proficiency. Your ability scores matter, too. For instance, to craft a scroll you need proficiency with the scroll kit, and Arcana will help a lot.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip35": "Crafting can be performed during downtime while traveling. A character with a crafting operation in progress works on their task before sleeping.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip36": "Personality flags influence the dialog lines spoken by a character. They don't make choices for you - they simply change the flavor of the experience.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip37": "When speaking to an NPC, the most suitable character in the party will automatically use Insight to guess which approach is most likely to work with them.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip38": "Your group has a specific level of relations with each of the game's factions. The more they like you, the more items they will sell you, and the lower their prices will be.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip39": "When bringing back items from the Badlands, choose which faction to sell them to. This will influence your relations with them.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip40": "Disengage can be used as a main action, allowing you to move outside the enemies' range without risking opportunity attacks.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip41": "When an enemy is in a neighboring cell, you are engaged. If you move away from that enemy, you risk suffering an opportunity attack.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip42": "Rogues can use sneak attack to increase their damage when they attack an enemy that is in a cell next to an ally, unless they have disadvantage on their attack roll.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip43": "Wielding two light weapons allows you to perform a second attack with your bonus actions. Both weapons need the Light tag.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip44": "Wielding a finesse weapon allows you to use Dexterity as the main ability score for the attack, if it is better than Strength. Check for the Finesse tag.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip45": "A weapon with the Versatile tag can be used with one or two hands. If you leave the second hand slot empty, you'll deal more damage with such a weapon. Example: a longsword.",
  "Tip/&LoadingTip47": "To level up, your characters need to take a long rest. They will gain their new power when waking up.",

  "Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance03": "We had heard rumors, and then most of the elven troops garrisoned in our Valley left through the Gates to meet a dire threat, yet with enough left behind to ensure that imperial law still reigned supreme! \nOn this direst of days, the sky broke, lightning fell again and again, and - worst of all - magic failed! I remember quite vividly the ashen face of our resident wizard, a young scion of a minor branch of House Airgetine, as he told Eldoril Sharp-Blade, the officer left in charge of the Vale, that mana had disappeared and that he wasn't even able to light a candle with his magic. ",
  "Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance04": "Eldoril Sharp-Blade, was a no-nonsense elven veteran who quickly realized that none of his contingency orders covered such an occurrence. Like every thrall, I was planning a rebellion against the imperial order. In the middle of the destruction wreaked by this Cataclysm, Eldoril made me realize that our fates were intertwined: Without magic, without the empire behind him, there was no way he would be able to compel us to behave like good little imperial thralls. On the other hand, some of his patrols had brought back the corpses of very dangerous-looking monsters, and his men had the equipment, discipline, and training needed to face such fearsome foes.   ",
  "Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance05": "If only it had been that simple… The young Airgetine wizard thought himself the equal of a master in wit, if not in power, and managed to convince his personal guard to follow him on a trek towards the imperial heartlands, away from the taint of this travesty of discussion with thralls. As Eldoril didn't want to pitch his troops against fellow elves, he let them go, with a heavy heart. It was the last we heard or saw of them.",
  "Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance06": "One year after the Cataclysm, I met my first humans. Eldoril was able to tell me they were not, as I had thought, enemies but rather refugees turned allies of the Empire. And what a sorry bunch they were: some elderly, children, women, not many fighting men among them, and they were following an old man, Egil Karst, decked in clothes the color of fire. This first winter had been more than dire, but somehow, the steep walls of our valley had shielded us, and we had room left to shelter those people, provided they could forage for their own food. At that, Egil Karst, the cleric of Arun, gave a little smile and, out of nothing, conjured up a feast for his followers.",
  "Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance07": "We were all dumbstruck, magic was returning… And yet, our few remaining arcanists confirmed they could not sense mana. Egil confirmed this, explaining that he was only a vessel channeling the mana offered by the gods so that his flock could survive. Those human gods were real, and their magic was functioning. And those humans were all skilled with their hands, not being used to having magic at their disposal for every single task. Soon, they weren't refugees anymore but valued members of our community, helping mend and repair with their hands and stone and wood, instead of with spells and mana. ",
  "Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance08": "Their expertise was welcome as our foraging parties couldn't wander outside the fortress walls anymore, as the weather and the monsters had redoubled their assault. By now, even the fiercest of the anti-Manacalon among my miners approve of our tentative partnership with their erstwhile guards, as they have shown us that, no matter what their faults, their courage more than makes up for them. \nI am Kram Steel-Spine, the foreman of the mine, speaker to the elves, and Ceannard of the mines. Ceannard I remain, but of the whole Vale of Coparann, as we have chosen to rename our enclave. \nStrike true, fellow miners!",

  "Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content01": "It all began as a series of raids, pinpricks outside our walls, attacks on caravans. Enough to worry us and elicit a response, but nothing more! Alas! it was a trick and the raids proved to be guided by a cunning hand able to predict our reactions with unerring accuracy.",
  "Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content02": "And so the force we sent after the raiders got wiped out, almost to the last man. It was more than a raid from an orcish clan; it was a full invasion aimed at conquering our vale! We were almost surprised at the gates, but managed to close them in time! We had lost our finest but our walls were strong and we were able to produce weapons to replenish our depleted arrows and bolt stocks quite fast. This siege gave us pause, as we didn't quite understand its purpose. The only access to the Vale of Coparann goes through the pass blocked by our town and the fortress. The vale itself is only easily accessible if you can fly! Otherwise, the steep walls provide as fine a natural defense as I have ever seen! ",
  "Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content03": "And yet, they were so numerous that our numbers began to slowly dwindle, and we started to realize that we wouldn't make it on our own! And so I sent for my childhood friend, Joris Nikannen, using magical and also more mundane messengers to relay our plight! ",
  "Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content04": "Two weeks later, the orcs managed to break through our defenses and reach the inner court! The hour was dire and all able to bear arms were manning hastily erected barricades, as it was only a matter of time till the phalanx at the gate was worn down! And it was in that instance that Gromnir Stonefist and his mercenaries hit the enemy's rear! Fierce was his assault, but cunning too. A series of hit-and-run strikes from many directions, fireballs and lightning bolts exploding, and coming from what seemed like a thousand voices, war cries from known units of the Principality of Masgarth! The orcs thought the rescuers far more numerous than they were, and Captain Stonefist managed to strike hardest at the command group of the orcs, killing the blood shaman who was keeping the clans together. It broke their spirit! We had won, but the cost was great and the feeling in my mouth was mixed! Joris Nikannen saw it and found the words to shake me out of my gloom! ",

  "Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content02": "As my thesis in support of my candidacy for the rank of Junior Master of the Arcaneum at the School of Necromancy, I respectfully submit the results of my research into the nature and types of new magics brought to Solasta by the humans of Tirmar, in particular the effectiveness of those whom they call \"clerics\" in repelling and destroying undead creatures. This knowledge is of urgent importance as we struggle to understand these humans, and assess both the severity of the threat they may post to the Empire and the potential benefit they could bring to it once conquered.",
  "Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content03": "It is widely known that the magic of humans derives from the entities they call \"gods\" (\"goddesses\" in the feminine, and \"deities\" collectively). I call it \"divine magic\" in this thesis, to distinguish it from our own arcane magic that is the result of magical study. Just as arcane magic is organized into schools, some divine magic is comprised of eight areas of study, which the humans call \"domains.\" Each deity typically provides its clerics with access to two domains, representing its particular interests. The domain that corresponds most closely to the School of Necromancy is called the Domain of Oblivion.",
  "Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content04": "In addition to spells from two domains, a cleric has access to a wide array of other spells and powers, which are common to all regardless of their patron deity. Many are broadly similar in their effects to the spells of the School of Necromancy. There are two necromantic powers, though, that are completely new and unique: a cleric of any Tirmarian deity, if their rank is high enough, can repel undead creatures and even destroy them. The humans I have questioned believe that this is because their deities regard all undead creatures as \"unnatural\" - a word that reveals much about their primitive level of sophistication - and therefore undesirable, but they seem to know nothing about the means by which this result is achieved, speaking only about the \"will\" or \"power\" of their deities.",
  "Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content05": "The following pages examine the phenomenon of \"turning\" and destroying undead using both the classical thaumatological approach of Fathirien and her successors, and the more modern methods championed by Gorlindrien and the Practicalists. All conclusions are tentative. If this thesis is accepted, I propose to make this phenomenon my primary research topic.",

He tainted the peace of the grave with the uncleanliness of undeath, raising the fallen to muster an army. As he knew this was not a prayer that would gain the favor of Maraike, the lady of life and death, he and his followers couched their plan in the form of a curse instead, tricking their goddess into ensuring that their plan would succeed. Maraike granted their plea, but was not deceived. She cursed the conspirators as well, for they had been corrupted by evil and were denied her grace. They became the fallen, and those they raised from death became sorrow zombies, named after the curse of sorrow that they had wrought.",

They must forever skulk in the shadows until they repented. But Maraike's punishment was not all. Sorr-Tarr, the vile god of the Soraks, saw potential in the fallen. Without undoing Maraike's curse, he gave them powers to do evil: to corrupt others by their touch, and to create fouler servants than zombies.

The elves were in and of the air, without physical form but existing as swirling currents of air and mana, one with magic and with the world.",

  "Legal/&EarlyAccessDisclaimerDescription": "Hey there folks! Welcome to Solasta - or more specifically, the Early Access of Solasta: Crown of the Magister. We really appreciate your support. You're all fantastic!\n\nPlease bear in mind that you are playing an Early Access version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister which is still under development. This Early Access version contains around 10 hours of gameplay and gives you access to the full Character Creation Tool with all ancestries, classes, and archetypes unlocked, with a level cap at level 6. The full 1.0 release will see a price increase and will deliver the entire main campaign of Solasta: Crown of the Magister, as well as many side quests for you to discover. \n\nWe have done our best to provide a strong and enjoyable experience. However, do note that the Early Access version may contain some occasional bugs. You are warmly invited to send us feedback, report any bugs and problems, or suggest improvements on our Discord server (https://discord.com/invite/uu8utaF) as well on our official forums (https://forums.solasta-game.com/). Our goal is to continue working hand in hand with our players to make a game that is representative of what our community wants. Be sure that our team is currently working hard to release the full version of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game that will include lots of additional features and content. \n\nConsidering the fact that game development is a very iterative process, please understand that your save files on the Early Access version will likely be incompatible with larger updates and with the full game release. As such, if you are looking for the complete experience the full version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister can offer, we encourage you not to purchase this Early Access version, but to wait for the release of the full game. Alright, enough reading - go enjoy the game!",

  "Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_11_Any_Default": "Your beer is terrible, and that's being polite about it.",
  "Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_12_Bartender_NPC": "What? I've never had any complaints about the beer before!",
  "Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_13_Bartender_NPC": "Maybe your palate is not refined enough.",
  "Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default": "We'd like to stay for the night.",
  "Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_15_Bartender_NPC": "Sure! Just walk up to the suite and settle in.",
  "Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_16_Any_Default": "A suite? ",
  "Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_17_Bartender_NPC": "It's more like a large bedroom, really - but you know, this is the capital city.",

  "Narration/&Scavengers_Generic_Hello": "Clear skies, my friends.",

  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_4_Quartermaster_NPC": "I'm Annie Bagmordah, Quartermaster of the Scavenger's guild.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_5_Quartermaster_NPC": "We don't have a seat in there, but…",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_6_Quartermaster_NPC": "…they all know exploring the Badlands without us would be a bad idea.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_7_Quartermaster_NPC": "That's why you should stop by our headquarters downtown.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_8_Quartermaster_NPC": "You'll need our services, I'm sure.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_9_Any_Default": "Is that… compulsory?",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_10_Quartermaster_NPC": "No, but you'll find our services useful. Everyone does.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_11_Quartermaster_NPC": "Did lord Carran not tell you?",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_12_Any_Default": "No - he pretty much stuck to giving orders.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_13_Quartermaster_NPC": "Ah, right. Anyway, we offer plenty of help and advice to beginners like you.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_14_Joker_Default": "We are grown-ups, you know. At least, most of us are.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_15_Quartermaster_NPC": "Of course you are. Well, good luck!",

  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_22_Authority_Default": "So what do you think? Should we check out their headquarters? ",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_23_Pragmatism_Default": "It's not far, but…",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_24_Violence_Default": "I've had enough talking - let's go kill some monsters!",

  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Pragmatic_Default": "What kind of help do you offer to people like us?",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Quartermaster_NPC": "Simple. Now, people like you typically carry out missions for the Council…",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_9_Quartermaster_NPC": "…in the Marches, even the Badlands. Sometimes far away, like Captain Merran.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_10_NosyAuthority_Default": "Who's Captain Merran?",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_11_Quartermaster_NPC": "You really must be new. She's one of yours: Senior Deputy of the Council.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_12_Quartermaster_NPC": "Anyway - you trek out to some old ruin in the Badlands, kill a bunch of orcs…",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_13_Quartermaster_NPC": "…well, you're still a bit green, so let's say goblins.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_14_Joker_Default": "Ouch! You're hurting our feelings!",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_15_Quartermaster_NPC": "Orcs will hurt more than your feelings, believe me.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_16_Quartermaster_NPC": "And stop interrupting! It's rude.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_17_Quartermaster_NPC": "So let's say you find yourself with a whole load of rusty swords, leather armor, shields…",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_18_Quartermaster_NPC": "…too much for you to lug back here.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_19_Joker_Default": "Oh - so we're puny as well as green? Thanks so much!",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_20_Quartermaster_NPC": "So instead, you brave heroes just clear the place of monsters and draw us a nice, clean map.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_21_Quartermaster_NPC": "Then we take our carts and pick up every piece of junk…",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_22_Quartermaster_NPC": "…we bring it back, we sell it, and we split the profits with you.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_23_Quartermaster_NPC": "We move the stuff, you go off to kill more bad things, everybody wins.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_24_Joker_Default": "For a percentage, of course.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_25_Quartermaster_NPC": "What? You could never carry it all, anyway.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_26_Quartermaster_NPC": "Not in your little backpacks.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_27_NosyAuthority_Default": "Do you know Arwin Merton, the so-called First Scavenger?",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_28_Quartermaster_NPC": "Of course.",

  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_31_Quartermaster_NPC": "I'd rather not talk about him.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_32_Friendly_Default": "Fair enough.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_33_Selfpres_Default": "Do you sell healing potions?",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_34_Quartermaster_NPC": "No, we don't. There's a shop for that.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_35_Quartermaster_NPC": "However…",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_36_Quartermaster_NPC": "We've got something even better.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_37_Quartermaster_NPC": "Say one of you gets killed out there in the Badlands.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_38_Joker_Default": "Here we go again…",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_39_Quartermaster_NPC": "Normally, you'd have to come back in a hurry to get them raised.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_40_Quartermaster_NPC": "Instead, you tell us about your misfortune, and we'll go get your friend's body.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_41_Quartermaster_NPC": "We take it to a cleric we know, and praise be! He raises your friend from the dead.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_42_Quartermaster_NPC": "It's a flat fee, and very reasonably priced.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_43_Quartermaster_NPC": "Not a comfortable subject, I know. Perish the thought and so on - but it happens.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_44_Greed_Default": "That's not cheap, I'm sure.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_45_Quartermaster_NPC": "Well… it's risky, and clerics need pretty gemstones for these spells… but can you really put a price on peace of mind?",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_46_Authority_Default": "Well, thank you. I guess that's it for us.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_47_Quartermaster_NPC": "Fine. Feel free to visit us anytime. Or drop into any Scavenger camp.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_48_Nosy_Authority_Default": "Are there others?",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_49_Quartermaster_NPC": "Anywhere we can settle. ",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_50_Quartermaster_NPC": "By the way, if you find Captain Henrik, tell him we're still interested.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_51_Authority_Default": "In what?",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_52_Quartermaster_NPC": "In getting our people to Caer Lem.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_53_Quartermaster_NPC": "The outpost is perfect for us. Close to the Badlands, with plenty of space for our camp.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_54_Authority_Default": "Right, we'll tell him if we find him.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_55_Quartermaster_NPC": "That would be appreciated. ",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_56_Quartermaster_NPC": "The more you do for us, the more we do for you.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_57_Greed_Default": "Oh? So this… business relationship can get better?",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_58_Quartermaster_NPC": "And I hope it will, friend.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_59_Any_Default": "I guess we'll see you around, then.",
  "Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_60_Quartermaster_NPC": "Sure. Good luck out there, and don't forget - in the Badlands, always keep your eyes open.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival1_Starter_Noflag": "So that's Caer Lem?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival2_Partner_Noflag": "We're almost there… it's just up the hill.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival3_SelfPres_Noflag": "It's a little too quiet, don't you think?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival4_Pragmatism_Slang": "We're in the Marches, so quiet can't be trusted.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival5_SelfPres_Normal": "True. Let's keep our eyes open.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival6_SelfPres_Formal": "Quite so. We must be on our guard.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival7_Authority_Normal": "Eyes up and hands on hilts, people. These are the Marches.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival8_Authority_Formal": "Hold formation, all! The Marches are full of perils.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival9_Selfish_Cynical_Normal": "Who put you in charge?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival10_Selfish_Cynical_Slang": "Don't play the captain with me.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival11_Authority_Normal": "I'm just saying, be ready for anything.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival12_Authority_Formal": "Simply a suggestion. I meant no offense.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival13_Default_Slang": "Damn right. Let's get on with it.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival14_Default_Normal": "All right. Let's just keep going.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival15_Default_Formal": "Agreed. We should press on.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance16_Default_Noflag": "I have a bad feeling about this.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance17_Partner_Slang": "Where's the garrison? Dead or run away?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance18_Partner_Normal": "There's no one here. Not even corpses.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance19_Default_Noflag": "Look! That tower… that's insane!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance20_NOSY_Noflag": "Amazing! Classic Tirmarian architecture… I read about that, you know.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance21_NOSY_Noflag": "It just ended up here after the Cataclysm… incredible!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance22_LUKEWARM_Slang": "Courtesy of the Cataclysm.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance23_LUKEWARM_Slang": "The Marches are full of stuff like this. The Badlands are worse.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance24_Cynic_Normal": "I never saw a tower just stuck in a mountain like that.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance25_Default_Normal": "We're not in the Badlands yet, but that's a good introduction.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance26_Authority_law_Noflag": "Anyway, we have a mission. Let's check the fortifications.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield1_Cynical_Formal": "Well, that's not a good sign.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield2_Cynical_Normal": "Does this tell us anything we don't already know?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield3_Pragmatic_Normal": "The blood isn't that fresh, but even vultures would have left some bones behind.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield4_Pragmatic_Formal": "There's enough blood here to suggest that the whole garrison was massacred.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield5_Any_Normal": "Maybe it was the goblins… they took the soldiers and… ate them?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield6_Pragmatic_Normal": "Those goblins were only a handful… A fifty-strong garrison would have made mincemeat of them.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield7_Any_Normal": "Well then, I'm out of ideas. Let's keep looking around.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Inside27_Pragmatism_Noflag": "There's definitely been fighting here.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Inside28_cynicWISECRACKER_Noflag": "Why did we take this job again? Oh, yeah… these lovely Council badges.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Inside29_cynicWISECRACKER_Formal": "No one here to greet us? How rude! I was hoping for drinks, at least.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Inside30_Authority_React": "This is no time for jokes.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Inside31_Selfpres_Noflag": "Right. Whoever did this could still be around, and we don't want them hearing us.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Inside32_Helpful_Noflag": "We should look for survivors. Fifty people can't just vanish.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem33_Starter_Normal": "Did you see that?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem34_Starter_Slang": "What the heck was that?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem35_Partner_Default": "Someone's hiding inside the tower.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem36_Self_Pres_Default": "It's a trap! The goblins killed everyone, and now it's our turn!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem37_Helpful_Default": "Or they're the survivors, and they're being cautious.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem38_Pragmatism_Default": "We need to get up to that door.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem39_Selfpres_Default": "That won't be easy. These walls are falling apart.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem40_Violence_Default": "If they slaughtered the garrison, they'll pay!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem41_Beryl_NPC": "Back off! No closer!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem42_Starter_Default": "Who's there?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem43_Robar_NPC": "We're not letting you in!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem44_Beryl_NPC": "And we're not coming out!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem47_Starter_Default": "Is Captain Henrik there? We need to talk to him!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem48_Beryl_NPC": "Don't you dare speak his name, you filthy bastard!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem49_Robar_NPC": "Don't talk to them!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem50_Lisbath_NPC": "They'll cast a spell on you!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem51_Beryl_NPC": "Don't touch me!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem52_Pragmatism_Normal": "Is something not right in there, or is it just me?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem53_Pragmatism_Slang": "Lost their minds, the lot of 'em.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem54_Pragmatism_Formal": "Clearly their distressing experience has affected their reason.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem55_Joker_Normal": "Filthy bastard'. Should we write that down in our report?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem56_Joker_Slang": "That's our report, then: they've all gone crazy. Mystery solved.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego78_Practical_Default": "Let's get to the door. Maybe if they can see us up close… ",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego79_Practical_Default": "…we can show them our Council badges.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego1_Robar_NPC": "They're here!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego2_Beryl_NPC": "You damn Soraks!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego3_Starter_Default": "Soraks?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego4_Partner_Default": "Did they say Soraks?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego5_Starter_Slang": "Ooh, they spotted it… we're shapeshifters from another world! Guess we'll have to go home now.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego6_Starter_Normal": "You can't be serious! Soraks are a legend for scaring children. ",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego7_Beryl_NPC": "You bastards took the Captain, but you won't take us!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego8_Robar_NPC": "Don't talk to them!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego9_Choice_1_WRITTEN": "We're Council deputies!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego10_Choice_2_WRITTEN": "Use spy call phrase",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego11_Choice_3_WRITTEN": "Use sellsword experience",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego12_Choice_4_WRITTEN": "Be reasonable!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego13_Authority_Normal": "We're deputies of the Council, sent by Protector Leira Kean!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego14_Beryl_FailedCheck": "Nice to meet you… I'm Princess Ceiwad. Get lost!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego15_Lisbath_FailedCheck": "Open the damn door, there are only four of them.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego16_Robar_SuccessCheck": "They have Council badges.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego17_Beryl_SuccessCheck": "Sure. Of course they do! Looted from whose corpses?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego18_Spy_Default": "So, sleeping in the beds of the Manacalon, are you?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego19_Beryl_NPC": "What?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego20_Defaulter_Default": "What was that?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego21_Spy_Default": "Just fishing. Give it a moment.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego22_Darik_NPC": "Magic pillows give us sweet dreams.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego24_Sellsword_Default": "I know how you feel… I fought at Sandreed. Lost a lot of good friends there.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego25_Robar_NPC": "Sandreed, eh? Which unit?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego26_Beryl_NPC": "What happened to \"don't talk to them\"?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego27_Sellsword_Default": "The Longswords, under Lord Dalmore.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego28_Sellsword_Default": "He died on the third day… arrow in the eye. ",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego29_Sellsword_Default": "Jonas Mills was the real leader… fought to the bitter end.",

  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego31_Defaulter_Default": "Be reasonable and open the door. We're friendlies!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego32_Beryl_NPC": "Exactly what a Sorak would say.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego33_Defaulter_Default": "Come on! There are just four of us… Point crossbows at us if you like.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego34_Lisbath_NPC": "Let's do that! People… crossbows at the ready.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego35_Robar_NPC": "Fine with me. Daliat, open the door.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego36_Beryl_NPC": "No! I said no!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego37_Robar_NPC": "Close the door.",

  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego42_Beryl_NPC": "Second in command… After Captain Henrik.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_Default": "So, you really believe you were attacked by Soraks?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego44_Beryl_NPC": "Man-sized lizards that can speak? ",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego45_Beryl_NPC": "Oh, yeah… they're real.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego46_Starter_NPC": "But we found no corpses… nothing.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego47_Beryl_NPC": "We know. They took all the bodies, ours and theirs.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego48_Beryl_NPC": "So no one can prove they exist.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_WRITTEN": "That's awkward.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_WRITTEN": "That's hard to believe.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_WRITTEN": "That's garbage.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_Normal": "No proof… that's kind of awkward.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_Formal": "You realize, of course, how improbable that sounds?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_Slang": "Course they did… just to make you look crazy.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego52_Beryl_NPC": "You won't laugh when they come back.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego53_Default_Default": "We got here without trouble.",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego54_Beryl_NPC": "Then they let you in… and now you're trapped with us.",

  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego56_Beryl_NPC": "How should I know? They're Soraks!",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego57_Starter_Slang": "Mind if we talk to your buddies?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_Formal": "Might we have a little chat with your comrades in arms?",
  "Narration/&CaerLem_Nego59_Starter_Normal": "We'd like to talk to everyone here, if that's all right?",

  "Narration/&Council02_3_12_Pragmatic_Default": "Between that and the Soraks, we caused quite a fuss out there.",
  "Narration/&Council02_3_13_Pragmatic_Default": "They'll reconvene the Council when you're ready.",
  "Narration/&Council02_3_14_Pragmatic_Default": "But trust me, there's a lot of people who want to talk to you first.",

  "Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_11_MaddyGreenisle_NPC": "And if things go well, we might share some of our own secrets.",
  "Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_12_Authority_Default": "All right - we'll think about it.",
  "Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_1_HalmanSummer_NPC": "Greetings, Sorak slayers!",

  "Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_7_HalmanSummer_NPC": "…how about that for neutrality?",
  "Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_8_HalmanSummer_NPC": "Anyway, we'd be interested in any antiquities you might bring back. ",
  "Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_9_HalmanSummer_NPC": "We pay very well, even for things you might think are worthless.",
  "Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_10_Cynical_Default": "Like the Scavengers?",
  "Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_11_HalmanSummer_NPC": "The Scavengers? They'd sell an antique Emperor's sword for its metal value.",
  "Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_12_HalmanSummer_NPC": "But we can offer more than gold.",
  "Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_13_HalmanSummer_NPC": "Antique magical items, for instance. You'll never find their like elsewhere.",
  "Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_14_Friendly_Default": "Good to know. Thanks for the invitation.",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC": "Can I ask for a minute of your time, deputies?",

  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_5_AnyNotElf_Default": "And the Arcaneum belongs to the New Empire. Do you really want to be seen talking to us?",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC": "My business is magic, not politics. And no, I have no quarrel with you.",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC": "You may not see us Imperials as friends, but we take the Council very seriously.",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_8_HeddlonSurespell_NPC": "We are particularly interested in anything from the Old Empire that you might find in the Badlands.",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC": "Anything from the Manacalon-era Arcaneum, even more so.",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_10_HeddlonSurespell_NPC": "Of course we'd pay you handsomely for this Crown, but I know that is not possible.",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default": "You're smarter than you look.",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC": "Also quite indifferent to mockery.",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_13_HeddlonSurespell_NPC": "Anyway, we have an unrivaled trove of magical and other knowledge.",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_14_HeddlonSurespell_NPC": "Think it over. You can find me at the Gravekeep's Cask.",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_15_Lawful_Default": "Really? Not at the embassy?",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC": "What can I say? I love Martel's beer. Even though it tastes like donkey piss…",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_17_Selfpres_Default": "What? How did he… ?",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_18_Selfpres_Default": "That was our joke, the first day we met. Was he spying on us?",
  "Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_19_Pragmatic_Default": "Maybe he just agrees about the taste.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "Would you have a moment, deputies?",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default": "All right, but make it quick.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_3_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "I'll do my best.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_4_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "I am Joriel Foxeye, from the Circle of Danantar.",

  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Default": "Is she a good student? A powerful wizard?",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_8_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "That's not for me to say - and you seemed to be in a rush?",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_9_Nosy_Default": "Fine.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_10_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "I just want you to know that our grand master Edvan Danantar has noticed you.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default": "He talked a lot, for sure.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_12_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "He's a man of great authority.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "He'd like you to know that our doors are open to you if you'd care to visit us.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "You can find me at Sunblaze Court.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_14_Pragmatic_Default": "Interested in Badlands treasures, I suppose, like everyone else?",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_15_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "Well, if you ever come across old spellbooks or spell scrolls, we'd love to see them.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_16_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "In return, we have the largest collection of spells and potion recipes you could ever hope to see.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_17_Nosy_Default": "More than the Arcaneum?",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_18_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "They would disagree - but yes.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_19_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "Now, if you were to prefer feeding the New Empire's wizards with more magical knowledge than the Principality…",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_20_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "…that would be troubling to many on the Council.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_21_Lawful_Default": "Neutrality means we don't treat you any differently than we treat them.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_22_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "Of course. Neutrality is the rule.",
  "Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_23_JorielFoxeye_NPC": "Good day to you, deputies.",

  "Narration/&NightAttack2_18_Cynical_Formal": "In that case, you'd be happy to advise us further, I presume?",
  "Narration/&NightAttack2_19_HeddlonSurespell_NPC": "Certainly. Always drink wine at the Gravekeep's Cask. Their beer is utterly foul.",
  "Narration/&NightAttack2_20_Pragmatic_Normal": "Seriously? Everyone knows that!",

  "Narration/&NightAttack3_6_CaptainIronshell_NPC": "During the night. It's lucky you weren't there.",
  "Narration/&NightAttack3_7_Cynical_Formal": "Eh. We could have handled a burglar or two.",
  "Narration/&NightAttack3_8_Cynical_Normal": "No doubt we would have seen the villains off, had we been there.",
  "Narration/&NightAttack3_9_CaptainIronshell_NPC": "They were more than simple burglars, to infiltrate the palace undetected.",

  "Narration/&Council5_11_LeiraKean_NPC": "You will wait for your turn to speak, senior deputy!",
  "Narration/&Council5_12_Crownbearer_Default": "We searched the Badlands for these gems, and now you're just taking the Crown away from us?",
  "Narration/&Council5_13_LeiraKean_NPC": "Order!",
  "Narration/&Council5_14_Danantar_NPC": "We are all well aware of your reservations, and we understand them.",
  "Narration/&Council5_15_Danantar_NPC": "Yet, from what I heard, all parties have agreed that you should comply…",
  "Narration/&Council5_16_Danantar_NPC": "…for the security of all.",
  "Narration/&Council5_17_Crownbearer_Default": "Security? You talk of security?",
  "Narration/&Council5_18_Crownbearer_Default": "What security? Just last night, Soraks attacked our quarters in the residence!",
  "Narration/&Council5_19_Faisech_NPC": "What?",
  "Narration/&Council5_20_Sunblaze_NPC": "Soraks? Here in Caer Cyflen?",

  "Narration/&Council5_42_Faisech_NPC": "Wait! Who's going to take the Crown, and where?",
  "Narration/&Council5_43_Danantar_NPC": "Well, the most secure location would be…",
  "Narration/&Council5_44_Danantar_NPC": "…the temple of Einar, of course. The Hearth.",
  "Narration/&Council5_45_Faisech_NPC": "Of course - right here in Caer Cyflen!",
  "Narration/&Council5_46_Faisech_NPC": "Neutral ground, of course, but still the Principality of Masgarth is the center of Solasta!",
  "Narration/&Council5_47_Danantar_NPC": "Do you have a better idea, Dean Faisech?",
  "Narration/&Council5_48_Faisech_NPC": "We have secure locations, too!",

  "Narration/&Council5_74_HalmanSummer_NPC": "It's about the secret cult of Arivad.",
  "Narration/&Council5_75_Nosy_Default": "What?",
  "Narration/&Council5_76_HalmanSummer_NPC": "I admit, this is second-hand intelligence, but still…",
  "Narration/&Council5_77_Authority_Default": "Speak up.",
  "Narration/&Council5_78_HalmanSummer_NPC": "One of my people saw a man with a tattoo…",
  "Narration/&Council5_79_Selfpres_Default": "The letter A?",
  "Narration/&Council5_80_HalmanSummer_NPC": "Yes. He followed the man all day, and to a gathering that night…",

  "Narration/&Council5_82_Authority_Default": "What village?",
  "Narration/&Council5_83_HalmanSummer_NPC": "It's called Earcorn. Very small…",

  "Narration/&Council5_After_5_Selfpres_Slang": "The Council's rotten.",
  "Narration/&Council5_After_6_BericSunblaze_NPC": "The Council's still young. Everyone is angling for influence…",
  "Narration/&Council5_After_7_BericSunblaze_NPC": "…but squabbling academics are better than clashing armies.",
  "Narration/&Council5_After_8_Nosy_Default": "Only Airgetine supported us? I mean, beside you.",
  "Narration/&Council5_After_9_Selfpres_Default": "Why would the New Empire be the only friend we have in there?",
  "Narration/&Council5_After_10_BericSunblaze_NPC": "Airgetine's a moderate, it's true, but the New Empire is subtle. Plans within plans.",
  "Narration/&Council5_After_11_BericSunblaze_NPC": "It's hard to say whether he was following orders or voting his conscience.",

  "Narration/&Council5_After_15_Crownbearer_Default": "Better than I expected.",
  "Narration/&Council5_After_16_Any2_Default": "Same for me, actually. It almost feels like we still have the Crown.",
  "Narration/&Council5_After_17_Any3_Default": "Exactly. We lost its magical power, but…",
  "Narration/&Council5_After_18_Any2_Default": "…the voice is still calling.",
  "Narration/&Council5_After_19_BericSunblaze_NPC": "Interesting. So the attunement is unaffected by physical separation?",
  "Narration/&Council5_After_20_Friendly_Any": "Keep the Crown safe, Marshal, will you, please?",

  "Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_14_Pragmatic_Normal": "What, exactly?",
  "Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_15_Merton_NPC": "They're here.",
  "Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_16_Selfpres_Default": "Who? The Soraks?",

  "Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd4_Any_Default": "That's right. We should probably sell it. How much do you think a smallish palace costs these days?",

  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_30_Telerien_NPC": "Deliver a pack of meat to the capital city.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_31_Telerien_NPC": "My friend Henrik, the butcher, will give you a receipt to bring back to me.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_34_Telerien_NPC_if_No": "Oh, well. There's always tomorrow!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_35_Telerien_NPC_if_Yes": "Many Thanks!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_37_Any_ChoiceC": "What do you know about this less than fair valley?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_38_Telerien_NPC": "It is sealed off from the outside, since the only exits are controlled by the redeemers.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_39_Telerien_NPC": "The ruler of the valley is called Orenetis. He is some kind of magician.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_40_Telerien_NPC": "He lives in the city - in the upper city, to be precise!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_41_NOAUDIO_Choice1": "Redeemers?",

  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_44_Any_Choice1": "What can you tell us about the Redeemers?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_45_Telerien_NPC": "Giant insects, very aggressive and territorial. They live in the mountains all around the Valley.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_46_Any_Choice1": "That bad?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_47_Telerien_NPC": "I never heard of any way around them!",

  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_50_Any_History": "The name 'Caer' does hint at a Manacalon origin, before the Cataclysm.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_51_Any_Normal": "A Manacalon fortress? It survived the Cataclysm?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_52_Telerien_NPC": "I've been there, and the architecture is clearly Imperial. There really is no accounting for taste…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_53_Any_Normal": "You mentioned an upper city.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_54_Telerien_NPC": "Aye - Orenetis and his court live there. The lower city is home to the common folk...",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_55_Telerien_NPC": "Orenetis isn't quite as…racist as the Empire was, but his inner circle, they're only high elves…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_56_Any_Choice3": "Orenetis is the ruler?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_57_Telerien_NPC": "Yes - our beloved Lord Protector!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_58_Any_Default": "Was he already the ruler at the time of Cataclysm?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_59_Telerien_NPC": "Possible, thought I wasn't around at that time!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_60_Any_History": "Unlikely, surprising, and yet - fascinating!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_62_Telerien_NPC": "We meet again! I hope the valley treated you well!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_63_Any_Default": "Clear skies, friend!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_64_Any_Slang": "Can't complain!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_65_Telerien_NPC": "I still have this small errand, if you're interested!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_66_Any_Default": "The delivery to Henrik?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_67_Telerien_NPC": "Yes indeed! We just got some fresh meat again!",

  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_5_Samko_NPC": "I'd like to ask you something, too...",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_6_Samko_NPC": "...since I gather you're trekking through the area.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_7_Any_Default": "What do you need ?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_8_Samko_NPC": "Some friends of mine vanished while checking some ruins nearby.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_9_Samko_NPC": "As surely as if a blizzard buried them on the tundra!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_10_Any_Default": "And you want us to find them?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_11_Samko_NPC": "If they are alive, please bring them back!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_12_Samko_NPC": "If you find proof of their deaths, I'd like to return it to their families.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_13_Any_Default": "What proof would that be?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_14_Samko_NPC": "They'd carry an amulet of the Forge, like mine.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_15_Samko_NPC": "If you find corpses with that…well…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_16_Samko_NPC": "Don't underestimate the dangers of this valley!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_17_Samko_NPC": "I am not sending you after a remhoraz, but watch out nonetheless!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_18_Samko_NPC": "Thanks, friends!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_19_Samko_NPC": "Stay in the light!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_2_Rose_NPC": "Hey friends, do you have a minute?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_4_Rose_NPC": "The people of the city need a favor, I think you might be able to help.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_6_Rose_NPC": "There's this elf, a nobleman and a drunkard.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_7_Rose_NPC": "Every night he bullies poor citizens near the Merry Remorhaz.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_8_Rose_NPC": "Someone needs to give him a…lesson in manners, if you take my meaning.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_9_Any_Violence": "I think we do. A punch in the face, perhaps?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_10_Any_Friendliness": "We could speak to him without violence.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_11_Any_Pragmatic": "We'll see.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_12_Rose_NPC": "I don't want to lie to you. If he's hurt, he might go whining to the Lord Protector.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_13_Any_Selfpres": "So, it's probably better just to scare him?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_14_Rose_NPC": "That's for sure!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_15_Any_Friendliness": "Don't worry, Rose - we'll take care of him!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_16_Rose_NPC": "You're the best!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_18_Any_Pragmatic": "Hey, Rose! I think we took care of your problem.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_19_Any_Pragmatic": "Hey, Rose! Sorry - things didn't go as planned.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_20_Rose_NPC": "Well done! I don't think we'll see him around for a while.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_21_Rose_NPC": "Well, I suppose it'll do the job.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_22_Rose_NPC": "I hope the Lord Protector won't come after you, though!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_23_Any_Default": "Don't worry about that!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_24_Rose_NPC": "Well, if you have time, I heard that Henrik needed a hand with something.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_1_Henrik_NPC": "Ah, here you are!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_2_Henrik_NPC": "Rose told me what you did for us.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_3_Henrik_NPC": "True friends of the people, you are.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_4_Any_Default": "Don't mention it.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_5_Henrik_NPC": "So if you feel like doin' some more justice around here…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_6_Henrik_NPC": "…someone from the guard is a real poison.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_7_Henrik_NPC": "Lieutenant Sharp-Eyes.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_8_Henrik_NPC": "She's killed some innocent folk, I know that for sure.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_9_Henrik_NPC": "She uses her position to extort, steal, and brutalize honest citizens.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_10_Any_Default": "Let me guess, you'd like us to deal with this... Lieutenant Sharp-Eyes?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_11_Henrik_NPC": "That'd be a great service to the people.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_12_Henrik_NPC": "Frankly, I wouldn't mourn her death, but it's not our way.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_13_Henrik_NPC": "I hear she's after a posting closer to her home village.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_14_Henrik_NPC": "Also, I'm pretty sure she has a jeweled ring that she stole from the palace.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_15_Any_Default": "Stealing from the Lord Protector?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_16_Any_Default": "That's not smart - not smart at all!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_17_Henrik_NPC": "I see you're catchin' my drift.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_18_Henrik_NPC": "There are ways to get her away from here, anyhow. You'll find one, I'm sure.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_19_Any_Default": "Sounds like we have a luxury of possibilities.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_20_Henrik_NPC": "I heard the Lord Protector had Sharp-Eyes executed?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_21_Any_Default": "Malariel Brogarad did, more like.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_22_Henrik_NPC": "Well, she's no altar girl, that one.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_23_Henrik_NPC": "I heard Sharp-Eyes is gone?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_24_Any_Default": "To a better place, so it seems.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_25_Henrik_NPC": "Too bad her brutality might fall on other honest folk.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_26_Any_Default": "She knows what could happen if we were to denounce her.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_27_Henrik_NPC": "Fine. Thanks for your help, friends!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition1_Rose_NPC": "I meant to say - someone from our community would like to speak with you. Someone important.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition2_Rose_NPC": "It's Reya, the cleric.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition3_Any_Normal": "We know her. She's part of your little band, then?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition4_Any_Formal": "We've been introduced, though we had no idea she was part of your organization.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition5_Rose_NPC": "Well, we're just people helping each other, but Reya is very active and well respected.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition6_Any_Default": "We'll talk to her, then.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition7_Rose_NPC": "And thanks again for your support, my friends.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_2_Player_Default": "It seems she looks up to you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_3_Reya_NPC": "Well, she trusted you enough to confide…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_4_Reya_NPC": "As a cleric, I have to do more than just pray.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_5_Reya_NPC": "The people of the valley need help against the tyrant.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_6_Player_Default": "Orenetis?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_7_Reya_NPC": "He's not evil, really. Probably just…sick.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_8_Reya_NPC": "He's not always been that way.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_9_Reya_NPC": "Now he trusts awful people to do his bidding.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_10_Reya_NPC": "Like Malariel Brogarad.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_11_Reya_NPC": "She lets her high-elf guards treat us like we're Manacalon slaves.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_12_Player_Default": "That's unacceptable.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_13_Reya_NPC": "Indeed.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_14_Reya_NPC": "One of our friends is being held - and probably tortured - in one of the Lord Protector's outposts.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_15_Player_Default": "A military garrison?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_16_Reya_NPC": "I know it's a lot to ask, but you've done so much already.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_17_Player_Default": "We'll be personae non gratae if we attack that place.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_18_Reya_NPC": "If you can get him out without a slaughter, I'd be glad.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_19_Reya_NPC": "But if there's no other way…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_20_Player_Default": "Understood.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_21_Reya_NPC": "Thanks a lot, friends.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_22_PeopleGuy_NPC": "Thank you!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_23_Player_Default": "You can thank Reya when you see her.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_24_PeopleGuy_NPC": "She sent you?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_25_Player_Default": "She did.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_26_PeopleGuy_NPC": "I can't go back to the city. I'll hide at my brother's.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_27_Player_Default": "As you wish, friend.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_28_Player_Slang": "Shit!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_29_Player_Normal": "Damn!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_30_Player_Formal": "That is... less than satisfactory.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_31_Player_Liar": "We could tell Reya she was already dead...",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_32_Player_Truthteller": "We tried. We risked our lives, but it wasn't enough.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_33_Player_Pragmatic": "Let's go back.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_1_Rose_NPC": "My friends!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_2_Player_Default": "Rose, what's going on?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_3_Rose_NPC": "They took Reya!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_4_Player_Default": "What? Who?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_5_Rose_NPC": "Brogarad's praetorians, they accused her of plotting against the Lord Protector!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_6_Player_Cynical": "Well, that's not entirely wrong…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_7_Player_Lawful": "Shut up!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_8_Rose_NPC": "Can you save her?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_9_Player_Default": "Do you think they'll kill her?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_10_Rose_NPC": "No one comes back from these arrests!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_11_Rose_NPC": "They're interrogating her in public. That gives us our only chance.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_12_Rose_NPC": "If you go now, you can…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_13_Player_Selfpres": "Attack city guards ?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_14_Player_Selfpres": "Orenetis will kill us!",

  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_16_Rose_NPC": "We'll hide you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_17_Rose_Cynical": "Looks like there's more to the little beggar than meets the eye.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_18_Rose_NPC": "It's up to you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_19_Rose_NPC": "I know you'll do the right thing.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_1_Reya_NPC": "My friends!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_2_Reya_NPC": "You took an awful risk to save me!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_3_Player_Cynical": "You don't say.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_4_Player_Friendly": "Don't mention it, Reya! Come on - we need to hide!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_5_Reya_NPC": "We have a safe place, right under their noses! Follow me!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_6_Rose_NPC": "Reya! You're alive!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_7_Reya_NPC": "Thanks to them!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_8_Reya_NPC": "I told you they could be trusted!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_9_Reya_NPC": "Well, they certainly proved it!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_10_Reya_NPC": "Orenetis will know it's you. He's got eyes almost everywhere.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_11_Player_Selfpres": "But not here?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_12_Reya_NPC": "His weakness is that he trusts people based on how they look…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_13_Reya_NPC": "…he doesn't mind if they're stupid or incompetent.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_14_Player_Cynical": "I figured as much.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_15_Reya_NPC": "Well, now, the status quo is over - he's onto us!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_16_Player_Selfpres": "Who is 'us'?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_17_Rose_NPC": "The people of the city. We're more than just a mob, you know.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_18_Rose_NPC": "We are organized, we plan operations, we struggle against tyranny.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_19_Player_Selfpres": "Are we in a rebel hideout right now?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_20_Reya_NPC": "No.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_21_Reya_NPC": "The rebels are political opponents, really.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_22_Reya_NPC": "I doubt the people would be happier if they overthrew Orenetis.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_23_Reya_NPC": "They'd put another high-elf noble on a throne, probably from house Anfarel.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_24_Player_Default": "Oh…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_25_Rose_NPC": "We don't want a civil war, just to live our lives.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_26_Player_Violence": "And yet you say the status quo is over.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_27_Reya_NPC": "Orenetis is going too far. I simply complained about a stock of food being confiscated.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_28_Reya_NPC": "In response, Brogarad had me arrested.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_29_Reya_NPC": "We need to take that food back.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_30_Reya_NPC": "It's piled up in one of Orenetis's outposts.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_31_Player_Selfpres": "We could do that, but how do we leave the city without running into the guards?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_32_Reya_NPC": "There's one place the guards never go…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_33_Reya_NPC": "Good job, kids!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_34_Player_Default": "There's a mountain of food here!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_35_Reya_NPC": "Indeed! Grown by the people, for the people.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_36_Reya_NPC": "Thank you again! We owe you so much.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_37_Reya_NPC": "I need to organize its distribution, but when that's done, I'll return to the safe house in the city.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_38_Reya_NPC": "Meet me there if you want to help more.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_39_Reya_NPC": "You've gone too far to stop.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_40_Reya_NPC": "The people regard you as heroes, now.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_41_Player_Cynical": "Do we drink for free at the safe house, then?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_42_Player_Violence": "I hope we can play darts with a portrait of the Lord Protector.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_43_Player_Lawful": "This is serious, friends.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_44_Player_Lawful": "We'll see you soon, Reya.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_1_Reya_NPC": "Here you are!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_2_Reya_NPC": "Any problems entering the city?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_3_Player_Cynical": "As you said, the guards aren't that bright.",

  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_6_Reya_NPC": "I have something to confess.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_7_Player_Selfpres": "Uh, what?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_8_Reya_NPC": "I'm not the leader of the people in the city.",

  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_15_Rose_NPC": "Not really.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_16_Reya_NPC": "But Rose has found some important information.",

  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_23_Reya_NPC": "We could have been among them.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_24_Player_Friendly": "You?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_25_Reya_NPC": "Escaped slaves, yes.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_26_Rose_NPC": "I believe something happened in that secret complex.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_27_Rose_NPC": "Maybe a slave uprising.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_28_Rose_NPC": "Whatever's going on, it's still guarded from the outside.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_29_Rose_NPC": "If you agree to go, I can give you a map.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_30_Rose_NPC": "Free our people, that's all we ask.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_31_Player_NonElf": "Freeing slaves? You don't even have to ask!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_32_Player_Violence": "Give us the map - we're in!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_33_Rose_NPC": "Many Thanks, friends!",
  "Narration/&NPC_Complex_Scientist_05": "We can't leave the lab - there are too many mutants out there!",
  "Narration/&NPC_Complex_Scientist_06": "We had to destroy the gate so the mutants couldn't escape!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_1_Rose_NPC": "You did it, you…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_2_Rose_NPC": "Orenetis!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_3_Sitenero_NPC": "Please, child - I'm not him!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_4_Player_Default": "It's a long story.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_5_Player_Default": "This is Rose. She sent us here to save prisoners - slaves…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_6_Sitenero_NPC": "I see. You are a brave halfling.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_7_Rose_NPC": "Thanks…I guess…but if you're not him... then who are you?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_8_Sitenero_NPC": "To put it simply, I'm his good side - the part he lacks.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_9_Rose_NPC": "He definitely does!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_10_Rose_NPC": "And if we could somehow put the two sides back together - would he be... nicer?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_11_Sitenero_NPC": "I believe so, though he has to be willing.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_12_Rose_NPC": "We have to try. Things can't go on as they are.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_13_Sitenero_NPC": "He'll take some convincing.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_14_Player_Cynical": "It'll be hard to talk to him without all his goons around.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_15_Rose_NPC": "I may know a way.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_16_Player_Pragmatic": "Really?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_17_Rose_NPC": "There's a secret passage into the palace.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_18_Rose_NPC": "Only the servants know about it.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_19_Player_Violence": "And you never tried using that passage to murder Orenetis?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_20_Rose_NPC": "No one dared.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_21_Rose_NPC": "It leads right into his winter garden.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_22_Rose_NPC": "Would you face him? Help us convince him to…reunite?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_23_Sitenero_NPC": "It seems to be the only way, though I confess it scares me little.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_24_Player_Pragmatic": "Fine, then.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_25_Player_Pragmatic": "If we do this, can you help us get out of the valley?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_26_Sitenero_NPC": "Ah - you mean the redeemers?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_27_Sitenero_NPC": "He controls their queen.",

  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_30_Rose_NPC": "Meet me at the safe house. I'll show you how to infiltrate the palace.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_31_Rose_NPC": "You did it! You freed the slaves!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_32_Player_Default": "This place is sick…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_33_Player_Pragmatic": "A reflection of Orenetis' mind.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_34_Player_Violence": "We put an end to his experiments.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_35_Rose_NPC": "Good. The valley doesn't need any more monsters.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_36_Rose_NPC": "You'll always be welcome in our houses, friends.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_1_Telerien_NPC": "Clear skies, my friends!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_5_Telerien_NPC": "Many Thanks for the package from Henrik!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_6_Any_Default": "Doing our job!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_7_Telerien_NPC": "About jobs - I need your help again.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_8_Any_Default": "Another delivery?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_9_Telerien_NPC": "Not exactly. This job needs a more direct approach...- and involves some danger.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_10_Any_Slang": "What kind of danger?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_11_Telerien_NPC": "Nothing to worry strong souls like you, my friends!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_12_Telerien_NPC": "But one of our customers needs spider poison glands!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_15_Any_Default": "Glands?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_16_Telerien_NPC": "Yes. I can give you the location of a spider nest nearby!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_17_Any_Default": "If the nest is nearby, why don't you take care of it yourself?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_18_Telerien_NPC": "My friend, I'm a businessman. I can't do everything!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_19_Any_Sarcastic": "At least you are honest enough to admit it!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_20_Telerien_NPC": "And besides, such errands are a great way to... strengthen our friendship.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS01_1_Player_Any": "Well…still no sign of civilization…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS01_2_Player_Cynical": "…I remember Galar saying…",

  "Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS01_4_Player_Authority": "Stop whining. We're alive.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS01_5_Player_Selfpres": "Think we can still find this Marin Ving?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS01_6_Player_Selfpres": "I say if we can get out of here, we just forget him and go home.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_1_Telerien_NPC": "Clear skies, my friends!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_3_Telerien_NPC": "Lovely spider glands you brought me!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_4_Player_Default": "Happy to help!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_5_Telerien_NPC": "It's clear you're both capable and reliable, so I have another request...",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_7_Telerien_NPC": "...or rather, a forceful message to be delivered to some annoying neighbors.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_8_Player_Slang": "Annoying neighbors ?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_9_Telerien_NPC": "Yes! Not far from here, there's a small settlement of giants.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_10_Telerien_NPC": "They make our operations in this area more... complicated than we'd like.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_11a_Player_Default": "We already took care of your giants!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_11b_Player_Default": "And you want us to...?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_12a_Telerien_NPC": "I know, and Thanks!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_12b_Telerien_NPC": "...to take care of the problem.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_13b_Player_Default": "Meaning, kill a bunch of giants?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_13b_Telerien_NPC": "Whatever it takes. Just as long as we can continue our operations unhindered.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_14b_Player_Default": "And exactly what would it take?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_15b_Telerien_NPC": "I don't know - kill them, perhaps, or bribe them, or drive them away. Whatever works.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_19b_Telerien_NPC_if_Yes": "Thanks!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_25_Player_Goodbye": "Stay in the light, friend!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_25_Telerien_NPC": "What news of the giants?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_1_Telerien_NPC": "I heard you dealt with those giants!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_2_Player_Default": "We sure did!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_3_Telerien_NPC": "We have no idea how this is…helping us.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_4_Telerien_NPC": "I can't Thank you enough!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_5_Player_Default": "Any time!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_6_Telerien_NPC": "You have been great friends to me and my organization!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_7_Player_Default": "Glad to hear it!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_8_Telerien_NPC": "And we feel that should be recognized!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_9_Player_Default": "With another, harder job, I suppose?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_10_Telerien_NPC": "Oh, no - just another courier job. Not dangerous, but very confidential!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_11_Telerien_NPC": "We had to be sure of you, because this job will take you to our main base in the swamps!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_12_Telerien_NPC": "I'll give you some directions!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_1_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Welcome…visitors.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_2_Hasdrubal_NPC": "How did you find us?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_3_Player_Default": "Telerien sent us. We met near the waterfall.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_4_Player_Default": "He gave us this for you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_5_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Ah, I see.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_6_Hasdrubal_NPC": "He speaks highly of you!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_7_Player_Default": "Glad to hear that!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_8_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Did he give you something for me? A package?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_9_Player_Default": "Here you go!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_10_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Many Thanks!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_11_Player_Default": "Happy to be of service!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_12_Player_Greed": "No.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_13_Player_Lawful": "Eeeeh…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_14_Player_Greed": "He didn't.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_15_Hasdrubal_NPC": "I see…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_16_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Well, you know our business - feel free to use our services.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_2_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Perhaps you can help me with something.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_3_Player_Default": "You're supposed to carry stuff around, not us.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_4_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Yes, yes - I get the sarcasm…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_5_Hasdrubal_NPC": "No, you won't have to carry anything heavier than a pointed message!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_6_Hasdrubal_NPC": "A herd of dryads lives nearby, and they keep harassing us.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_7_Player_Default": "Why?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_8_Hasdrubal_NPC": "They only like animal visitors, it seems. I suppose we're trespassing.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_9_Player_Default": "Don't tell us you can't take on a bunch of dryads!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_10_Hasdrubal_NPC": "We could, but there are whispers of…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_11_Hasdrubal_NPC": "...a dryad queen, whom we dare not anger!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_12_Hasdrubal_NPC": "You're new here, and if you act swiftly…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_13_Hasdrubal_NPC": "…the blame won't fall on us.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_14_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Then we can continue our activities peacefully.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_15_Player_Cynical": "What activities? Scapegoating?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_16_Hasdrubal_NPC": "I get it - you're the funny one? Who's the grown-up one?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_17_Player_Authority": "Apologies…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_18_Hasdrubal_NPC": "That would be very much appreciated.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_19_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Rumor says that if you sleep under the millenium tree, the dryad queen will appear.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_20_Hasdrubal_NPC": "It's not far, to the east.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_1_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Greetings, my friends!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_2_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Let's cut to the chase.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_3_Player_Default": "Go ahead!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_4_Hasdrubal_NPC": "I need seasoned adventurers to escort some of my people to a meeting.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_5_Player_Default": "Why do they need an escort?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_6_Hasdrubal_NPC": "To be honest with you, I'm not entirely sure how this meeting might go down.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_7_Hasdrubal_NPC": "The people we're meeting with are... opponents of Orenetis.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_8_Player_Insight": "Opponents?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_9_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Well, rebels would probably be a more accurate term.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_10_Player_Default": "Rebels, huh?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_11_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Yes. Orenetis isn't as universally loved as he would like you to think!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_12_Player_Insight": "Why do you fear the rebels?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_13_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Like them, we prefer to live far from the Lord Protector.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_14_Hasdrubal_NPC": "But we don't share their…appetite for trouble.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_15_Hasdrubal_NPC": "There have already been some…misunderstandings.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_16_Hasdrubal_NPC": "I want us to remain neutral but the rebels…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_17_Hasdrubal_NPC": "…they want us to take sides.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_18_Player_Default": "All right. How do we get there?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_19_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Talk to Hanno. He has a map.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_20_Hasdrubal_NPC": "And Thanks!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End1_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Is it done? The dryads?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End2_Player_Default": "It is. We have their queen's head.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End3_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Impressive!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End4_Hasdrubal_NPC": "You know, I would buy this trophy for a good price…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End5_Hasdrubal_NPC": "…unless you have any other use for it?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End6_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Deal!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End7_Hasdrubal_NPC": "As you wish.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_47_Rose_NPC": "Of course!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_29_Player_Any": "We took care of your problem, Henrik.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_20_Rose_NPC": "I can't believe she's dead.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_21_Rose_NPC": "We lost our way…lost our light.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_17_Player_Any": "By chance, really. We're just exploring the valley.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_18_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Right. We're peaceful people, so I hope you'll respect our privacy.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_19_Player_Any": "This place looks like a Scavenger's outpost.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_20_Hasdrubal_NPC": "We're basically Scavengers who got lost in the valley.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_21_Hasdrubal_NPC": "We call ourselves the Forge.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_22_Player_Any": "Oh, great - so you provide the same services as in the Principality?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_23_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Absolutely! We'll do business with you the very same way.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_1_Player_Default": "They don't look like typical bandits to me.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_2_Player_Default": "Hasdrubal told us this meeting could be a trap.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_3_Player_Default": "So what do we do?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_4_Player_Default": "We can go on to the meeting point openly…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_5_Player_Default": "…or be prepared for treachery.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_6_Player_Default": "We have to get to the bottom of this.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_7_Player_Default": "Let's go!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_1_Blue_NPC": "Clear skies!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_2_Blue_NPC": "You're late!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_3_Any_Default": "Yes. We had a spot of bother on the way.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_4_Any_Default": "Bandits who seemed well-informed…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_5_Blue_NPC": "Clearly you handled it!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_6_Blue_NPC": "Do I know you?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_7_Any_Cynical": "That night at the pub - was it you?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_8_Any_Authority": "Shut up!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_9_Envoy_NPC": "Look, Hasdrubal agrees to meet, but not just anywhere.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_10_Envoy_NPC": "Show some trust and invite us to your headquarters.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_11_Blue_NPC": "That's a lot to ask.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_12_Envoy_NPC": "Considering that we've been attacked on our way here, the risk goes both ways.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_13_Blue_NPC": "Fine, I'll pass it up the chain.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_14_Player_ChoiceA": "You'll do nothing but die, traitor!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_15_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA": "Attack the rebels",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_16_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB": "Say goodbye",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_17_Player_Default": "Look, Hasdrubal's envoy was killed. No point to this meeting any more.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_1_Hasdrubal_NPC": "What happened?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_2_Player_Any": "Bandits on the road.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_3_Envoy_NPC": "The meeting took place, the rebels deny being involved.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_4_Envoy_NPC": "Now we wait for their answer.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_5_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Thanks for your escort, my friends.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_6_Hasdrubal_NPC": "I'll need you again if we're invited.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_7_Hasdrubal_NPC": "If you agree to come with me.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_8_Player_Any": "Your envoy did not survive.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_9_Player_Any": "It ended in blood.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_10_Hasdrubal_NPC": "This is bad.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_11_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Well, you did what you could. Thank you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_1_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Thank you for coming, my friends!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_2_Any_Default": "What news, Hasdrubal?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_3_Hasdrubal_NPC": "I heard from the rebel leader, Ellaria Anfarel.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_4_Any_Default": "Yes?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_5_Hasdrubal_NPC": "They propose a meeting to ease the tensions between us!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_6_Any_Default": "Need us to tag along?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_7_Hasdrubal_NPC": "I'd feel better, yes.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_8_Any_Default": "Happy to be of service!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_9_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Good.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_10_Hasdrubal_NPC": "They finally told me where they are based.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_11_Hasdrubal_NPC": "It's an old buried Manacalon city called Dinas Gessa.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_12_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Obviously, that is confidential.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_1_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Greetings, My Lady!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_2_Ellaria_NPC": "Greetings to you, Master Hasdrubal.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_3_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Our last meetings were rudely interrupted.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_4_Ellaria_NPC": "Indeed. Which is why I invited you here...",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_5_Ellaria_NPC": "...and to assure you that these mishaps were not our doing.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_6_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA": "Tell them about Samko Flint",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_7_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB": "Persuade them to make peace",

  "Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_14_Krim_NPC": "Boots of the Winterland.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_15_Player_Default": "Sorry, we don't have that.",

  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_13_Sima_NPC": "Bring me back another item that was taken from me.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_14_Player_Any": "Really?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_15_Sima_NPC": "It's a box, in the Gartis outpost.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_16_Sima_NPC": "One of the Dominion's checkpoints in the valley.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_17_Sima_NPC": "If you bring it back to me, I'll tell you more.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_18_Sima_NPC": "Maybe even something about your guy, Marin Ving.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_19_Player_Any": "Ah.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_20_Player_Any": "Now we have to kill Dominion soldiers?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_21_Sima_NPC": "Again, proceed as you see fit. Maybe stealth will suffice.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_1_Sima_NPC": "Great! You did well!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_2_Sima_NPC": "Too bad you were spotted.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_3_Sima_NPC": "Fortunately, they're not sure it was you, otherwise you would have been arrested already.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_4_Player_Default": "Now, about our reward?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_5_Sima_NPC": "Right.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_6_Sima_NPC": "About your guy, I've heard rumors…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_7_Player_Default": "…which is not the same as solid intelligence, of course...",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_8_Sima_NPC": "… but sometimes it's all we have.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_9_Sima_NPC": "There's a group of people organizing secret meetings.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_10_Sima_NPC": "They're good - I still haven't identified their leader.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_11_Sima_NPC": "But it's a new thing, foreign.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_12_Sima_NPC": "Maybe that's your man.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_13_Player_Default": "Pretty thin on detail, but thanks anyway.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_14_Player_Default": "Now, about the Rebellion. Can you tell us more?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_15_Sima_NPC": "Not yet. Something came up.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_16_Player_Default": "What now?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_17_Sima_NPC": "Orenetis has placed a spy among some friends of mine.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_18_Sima_NPC": "Take him out and you'll have my trust.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_19_Player_Default": "Your trust doesn't come cheap.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_20_Sima_NPC": "Your choice.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_21_Sima_NPC": "The man is known as 'Charmer'.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_22_Player_Default": "Is that…the Forge headquarters?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_23_Sima_NPC": "I see you already know my friends.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_24_Sima_NPC": "So you'll be happy to get them rid of this worm.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_AtForgeHQ_1_Player_Default": "Murdering one of them, though? That doesn't seem... wise.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_AtForgeHQ_2_Player_Default": "Right. I mean we have no proof he's a spy.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_AtForgeHQ_3_Player_Default": "We could search his stuff.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_AtForgeHQ_4_Player_Default": "Look at that.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_1_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Charmer!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_2_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Why did you do that?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_3_Player_Default": "He was a spy for Orenetis!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_4_Hasdrubal_NPC": "What?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_5_Hasbrubal_NPC": "Can you prove it?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_6_Player_Default": "The rebels told us.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_7_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Oh, really? Who, exactly?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_8_Player_Default": "Sima Temple.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_9_Player_Default": "We can't tell.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_10_Hasdrubal_NPC": "We'll investigate, but this is not acceptable.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_11_Hasdrubal_NPC": "You should have come to me.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_10_Hasdrubal_NPC": "The matter is in our hands now, but thank you for finding this.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_3_Player_Default": "Your man Charmer - he's spying for Orenetis.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_11_Hasdrubal_NPC": "Holy Maraike! What's going on?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_5_Player_Default": "Take a look at this.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_2_Hasdrubal_NPC": "What? Ridiculous! I've known him for years!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_4_Hasdrubal_NPC": "You stole his backpack? That's really not…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_8_Player_Default": "Look inside.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_6_Hasdrubal_NPC": "A knighthood ring.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_7_Hasdrubal_NPC": "No need. I know these rings. Bearing the sign of the Lord Protector himself.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_9_Hasdrubal_NPC": "This is not solid proof, mind you, but we'll interrogate Charmer.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_1_Player_Default": "Charmer has been arrested. He won't be a nuisance to the Forge anymore.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_2_Sima_NPC": "So you didn't kill him?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_3_Player_Default": "Did you want help, or did you want assassins?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_4_Sima_NPC": "Fair enough.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_5_Player_Default": "Charmer is no more.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_6_Sima_NPC": "Good riddance!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_7_Player_Default": "I think we deserve the whole truth now, don't we?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_8_Sima_NPC": "Some of your actions still worry me.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_9_Sima_NPC": "The rebellion requires total commitment.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_10_Sima_NPC": "If you take some really decisive action against the tyrant, I'll introduce you to my superior.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_11_Player_Default": "What do you want now?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_12_Sima_NPC": "Take the Pertal outpost, and raise the flag of the rebellion on its walls.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_13_Player_Default": "Is that all? Why not storm the palace while we're at it!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_14_Sima_NPC": "We'll do that together, someday. If you really are what you claim to be.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_15_Sima_NPC": "I suppose so. Go to the temple and talk to a woman in red.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_16_Sima_NPC": "But if you'd like to take part in a decisive operation for the rebellion…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Hasdrubal_Banter_1_Charmer_Killed": "You were right about Charmer.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Hasdrubal_Banter_2_Bad_Reputation": "You're lucky I'm a businessman.",

  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_37_Cafrain_NPC": "No, of course you haven't. But we've heard of you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_38_Cafrain_NPC": "And we will make of this Valley a better place for everybody!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_39_Cafrain_NPC": "Except, of course, for the Lord Protector and his goons.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_40_Cafrain_NPC": "And talking about goons…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_41_Player_Default": "Yes?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_42_Cafrain_NPC": "Well, do you want to help us?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_43_Cafrain_NPC": "Then fetch a particular document from the Ice Princess' officers.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_44_Player_Default": "The Ice Princess?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_45_Cafrain_NPC": "Ever met Commander Malariel Brogarad?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_46_Player_Default": "You have spies in the city guard?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_47_Cafrain_NPC": "Don't ask too much too soon.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_48_Cafrain_NPC": "Bring me the papers, and we'll talk more.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_49_Player_Default": "We're kind of...unwelcome up there.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_50_Cafrain_NPC": "Really? Shame.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_51_Cafrain_NPC": "Well, if you find a way, we'll talk again.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_Read_1_Player_Default": "It's blank! What does that mean?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_Read_2_Player_Default": "Maybe it was just a test?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_1_Player_Default": "Here, your…document.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_2_Cafrain_NPC": "Thanks! Any problems along the way?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_3_Player_Default": "Not at all.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_4_Player_Default": "Your friend wasn't exactly talkative.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_5_Cafrain_NPC": "Not his job.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_6_Cafrain_NPC": "Are you planning to go back to the forest?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_7_Cafrain_NPC": "I need this package delivered to Samko.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_8_Player_Default": "Is it empty?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_9_Cafrain_NPC": "What? Of course not!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_10_Player_Default": "Will that make us part of the club?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_11_Cafrain_NPC": "Soon.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_12_Cafrain_NPC": "Good. Happy hunting!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_1_Samko_NPC": "Looks like you met Cafrain.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_2_Player_Default": "It felt more like a test than an actual job.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_3_Samko_NPC": "She must have told you - we're cautious.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_4_Player_Default": "Is your little club a real thing?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_5_Samko_NPC": "Sure is. We walk in the shadows, masked, but we're real.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_6_Samko_NPC": "Thanks for the message!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_7_Samko_NPC": "Next time you see Cafrain, the real business will begin.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_1_Cafrain_NPC": "Clear skies! I heard from Samko - Thanks for the delivery!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_2_Player_Default": "We aim to please!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_3_Cafrain_NPC": "I have another job for you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_4_Cafrain_NPC": "Something that will hurt the Dominion.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_5_Player_Default": "So, we're in the club now?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_6_Cafrain_NPC": "Yes, but stop calling it that.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_7_Player_Default": "What should we call it, then?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_8_Cafrain_NPC": "There's no real name. We're all hiding, masked, in the shadows.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_9_Player_Default": "Masked?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_10_Cafrain_NPC": "Do you want to hear about the job or not?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_11_Cafrain_NPC": "Good. You know the Dominion has outposts spread across the Valley, to keep control of it?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_12_Cafrain_NPC": "You're going to one of them.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_13_Player_Default": "Any particular reason?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_14_Cafrain_NPC": "The boss has a plan.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_15_Player_Default": "Who's the boss?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_16_Cafrain_NPC": "You really do like names, don't you?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_17_Player_Default": "We just want to know what we're signing up for.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_18_Cafrain_NPC": "Freedom. Take this banner and make it fly over the Feleg outpost.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_19_Cafrain_NPC": "Good hunting!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_1_Player_Default": "It's done - the outpost, the banner.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_2_Cafrain_NPC": "Thank you for that.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_3_Player_Default": "There's more, though…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_4_Cafrain_NPC": "What?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_5_Player_Default": "Turns out, the soldiers were rebels in disguise.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_6_Cafrain_NPC": "Really?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_7_Player_Default": "Yeah... to be honest, we feel used, a little.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_8_Cafrain_NPC": "I'm sorry. I didn't know you were friends with the Rebellion.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_9_Player_Default": "We can't go on without knowing who you really are.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_10_Cafrain_NPC": "Of course. It's time you knew.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_11_Cafrain_NPC": "We follow Vando Klarn, herald of Misaye.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_12_Player_Default": "Misaye, the Lady of Luck?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_13_Cafrain_NPC": "Yes! And soon you will have proved yourselves sufficiently…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_14_Cafrain_NPC": "...for me to introduce you to our leader.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_15_Player_Default": "And when will that be?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_16_Cafrain_NPC": "Come back tomorrow. I'll have a new mission for you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_15_Cafrain_NPC": "In the meantime, remember - Misaye kissed you today!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_1_Cafrain_NPC": "Still laughing, friends? I have another job for you!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_2_Player_Default": "Another bad apple?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_3_Cafrain_NPC": "Alas, no...This is a plan to stir the people up against Orenetis...",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_4_Cafrain_NPC": "...to make him show his dark side, so the people see who he really is…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_5_Player_Default": "How do you plan to achieve that?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_6_Cafrain_NPC": "There are some incriminating documents.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_7_Player_Default": "Incriminating against whom?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_8_Cafrain_NPC": "Doesn't matter!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_9_Player_Default": "What does matter, then?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_10_Cafrain_NPC": "What matters is that those documents are found at the Merry Remhoraz…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_11_Player_Default": "That would be very bad for the Innkeeper!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_12_Cafrain_NPC": "Karelia Snowfox is well-liked in the city. Her arrest could sway the people in our favor.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_13_Player_Default": "A bold move!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_14_Cafrain_NPC": "We are in Misaye's hands! Roll the dice and see what happens!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_End_1_Cafrain_NPC": "Well done!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_End_2_Player_Default": "It wasn't hard at all.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_End_3_Cafrain_NPC": "Good, then!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_End_4_Cafrain_NPC": "Vando Klarn is expecting you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_End_5_Cafrain_NPC": "Near the city's entrance, turn left. Behind the Dominion banner, you'll find a door.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_1_Klarn_NPC": "Well met!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_2_Player_Default": "So, you are Vando Klarn?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_3_Klarn_NPC": "Guilty as charged.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_4_Player_Default": "Are you going to enlighten us about your goals here?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_5_Klarn_NPC": "Misaye has a design for this valley, and I am but her messenger!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_6_Player_Default": "Ah - a man on a mission!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_7_Klarn_NPC": "Not in the way you think!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_8_Klarn_NPC": "Misaye loves freedom, and people like Orenetis are anathema to her!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_9_Player_Default": "He's powerful, though. What's your plan?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_10_Klarn_NPC": "At first it felt as hopless as catching Misaye herself - but Thanks to Cafrain, Samko, you, and some others...",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_11_Klarn_NPC": "...this holy mission is more than a forlorn hope!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_12_Klarn_NPC": "The strategy is simple: divide and conquer!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_13_Player_Default": "And our role?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_14_Klarn_NPC": "Right now, I need you to find me a way into the Rebellion's headquarters.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_15_Klarn_NPC": "I have a map that should lead you there, but I need a thorough reconaissance.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_16_Player_If_Rebel_HQ_already_visited": "Well, we've been there already.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_17_Klarn_NPC": "Ah! The Lady is smiling on us!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_18_Klarn_NPC": "I need to plan our next move based on this information.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_19_Klarn_NPC": "We'll talk tomorrow. You're welcome to stay here and use our hidden network through the city.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_20_Player_If_Rebel_HQ_not_visited": "We're on it!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_21_Player_Default": "Before we go…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_22_Player_Default": "…are you Marin Ving?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_23_Klarn_NPC": "I am...a simple servant of Misaye!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_24_Klarn_NPC": "Sweet laughter to you!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_25_Player_Default": "That's definitely him!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_26_Player_Default": "So what? - we grab him and drag him to Helia Fairblade?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_27_Player_Default": "Like we could!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_28_Player_Default": "If we help him overthrow Orenetis, maybe we'll get out of the valley.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_1_Klarn_NPC": "My friends - I had an interesting visit!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_2_Player_Default": "Pray tell!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_3_Klarn_NPC": "Our Lady of Luck has granted me a vision!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_4_Klarn_NPC": "Unworthy as I am, she favored me!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_5_Player_Default": "And what was this vision about?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_6_Klarn_NPC": "I saw a cave, near the Forge camp where you first met Samko Flint.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_7_Klarn_NPC": "Within there is an abandoned sanctuary, where Misaye was worshiped long ago.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_8_Klarn_NPC": "Go there, and clear the way for me.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_9_Klarn_NPC": "Her Whimsical Majesty has commanded me to re-consecrate this holy place.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_10_Player_Default": "A cave - that's pretty vague.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_11_Klarn_NPC": "I saw it clearly. I'll mark it on your map.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_12_Player_Default": "Misaye is laughing!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_13_Player_Default": "I think we found it, but we couldn't get inside.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_14_Klarn_NPC": "That is great news! Then it's just waiting for me!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_15_Player_Default": "We found the temple. It's closed - magically.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_16_Klarn_NPC": "Yes, I know.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_17_Klarn_NPC": "Re-consecrating a temple, or just re-dedicating it, -it's no small thing.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_18_Klarn_NPC": "The forces that desecrated it may still be there.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_19_Player_Default": "So you need bodyguards?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_20_Klarn_NPC": "Yes!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_21_Player_Default": "Given that your life is in the balance, and it seems you really need us…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_22_Klarn_NPC": "Fine! I know what you're going to ask!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_23_Klarn_NPC": "Yes, I am Marin Ving.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_24_Player_Default": "Can't believe it!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_25_Player_Default": "I was starting to think you were just a fable.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_26_Player_Default": "Or a Sorak.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_27_Klarn_NPC": "Oh, please…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_28_Klarn_NPC": "So, let's make a deal!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_29_Klarn_NPC": "Help me rid this valley of Orenetis and I'll go back to Masgarth with you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_30_Klarn_NPC": "As the new…ruler of the valley.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_31_Player_Default": "Sounds like you want diplomatic immunity or something.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_32_Klarn_NPC": "Well, our dear Princess wouldn't arrest the leader of a neighboring, sovereign state.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_33_Klarn_NPC": "Not in time of war.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_34_Player_Default": "We could just take you back by force.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_35_Klarn_NPC": "But you won't.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_36_Klarn_NPC": "Ah, Misaye's laughing at me now…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_37_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA": "We will.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_38_Player_Any": "Just watch us!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_1_Klarn_NPC": "Yes, this is it!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_2_Player_Default": "What's going on?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_3_Klarn_NPC": "The goddess has spoken!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_4_Klarn_NPC": "The moment is upon us! The people are enraged and the rebellion in disarray!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_5_Player_Default": "So?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_6_Klarn_NPC": "This is our chance to overthrow the tyrant!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_7_Player_Default": "You mean, attack the palace and kill Orenetis?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_8_Klarn_NPC": "He won't just surrender, I can promise you that!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_9_Player_If_SecretAccess_Known": "As it happens, we know a way into the palace.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_10_Klarn_NPC": "Wonderful news! Misaye smiles upon us!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_11_Player_If_SecretAccess_Not_Known": "Let's stock up on healing potions!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_12_Klarn_NPC": "A true believer!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_13_Klarn_NPC": "Misaye shall kiss us all!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_14_Player_Default": "Aye, I am a true believer - in being prepared!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_15_Player_Default": "Misaye is laughing enough at us as it is!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_16_Klarn_NPC": "And so she is!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_17_Klarn_NPC": "Once you're facing him, I'll join you for the fight.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_18_Klarn_NPC": "How will you do that? Teleporting?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_19_Klarn_NPC": "It's a secret.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_1_Player_Default": "Looks like we did it!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_2_Player_Default": "Why do you think of that, Ving?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_3_Klarn_NPC": "It's \"my Lord Protector\" now - even to you!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_4_Player_Default": "What?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_5_Klarn_NPC": "Ha! You should have seen your face!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_6_Klarn_NPC": "But please, show some respect when addressing me in public.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_7_Klarn_NPC": "I am the Lord Protector now! And I pledge that I will to keep the people safe!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_8_Player_Default": "The same title as Orenetis. That's a debatable choice…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_9_Player_Default": "…Ving.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_10_Klarn_NPC": "Touché. Well, people don't like big changes.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_11_Player_Default": "About pledges - you said you'd come back to the Principality with us?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_12_Klarn_NPC": "True - and I wish I could do that…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_13_Klarn_NPC": "…but after thinking it through, I'm afraid that's impossible.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_14_Player_Default": "What? Why?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_15_Klarn_NPC": "I have responsibilities here in the Valley. I can't just leave - there would be civil war!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_16_Player_Default": "Buy you gave us your word!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_17_Klarn_NPC": "My word as a citizen, yes - but now I am a ruler! But you are free to return to Masgarth.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_18_Klarn_NPC": "I forgot to tell you - I found out how Orenetis controlled armies of redeemers.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_19_Klarn_NPC": "He's taken their... queen as a sort of hostage.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_20_Klarn_NPC": "He has a scepter that will keep redeemers at bay. Here - take it!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_21_Player_Default": "And leave you as the new Lord Protector?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_22_Klarn_NPC": "Is that a problem?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_23_Player_Default": "We're supposed to take you back.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_24_Klarn_NPC": "To whom? Are you not free to make your own decisions, as Misaye decrees?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_25_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA": "We'll tell the Church and the Principality.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_26_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB": "We'll only tell the Church of Misaye.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_27_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC": "You're coming, dead or alive!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_28_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD": "We'll say we didn't find you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_29_Player_ChoiceA": "We'll tell the truth to the authorities.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_30_Klarn_NPC": "I'm sure the Princess will welcome diplomatic relations with the valley.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_31_Klarn_NPC": "I hear there are still Soraks out there…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_32_Klarn_NPC": "…and the Principality is on the brink of war.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_33_Klarn_NPC": "And please take my salutations to my disciple in Caer Cyflen, Leyrin Catpaw.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_34_Player_ChoiceB": "All right. We'll only tell the Church of Misaye.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_35_Klarn_NPC": "Fine, as you wish.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_36_Player_ChoiceC": "No way! If you won't come willingly…",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_37_Klarn_NPC": "Ohhh, you're no fun!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_38_Player_ChoiceD": "After all this we just want to go home. We never found you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_39_Klarn_NPC": "Stay neutral - a wise strategy!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_40_Player_Default": "Then I guess it's time for us to go.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_41_Player_Default": "Let's find this scepter and go home.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_1_Player_Default": "Are you the Lord Protector's assistant?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_2_Lysantir_NPC": "Ehhh - I guess so.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_3_Player_Default": "Are you in shock or something? Did they torture you?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_4_Lysantir_NPC": "No, no - nothing like that. I was just wondering…who you were.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_5_Player_Default": "The Lord Protector sent us to find you.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_6_Lysantir_NPC": "Oh - that's nice of him!",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_7_Player_Default": "What's wrong?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_8_Lysantir_NPC": "I'd prefer not to go back to Caer Hyfryd.",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_9_Player_Default": "Why not?",
  "Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_10_Lysantir_NPC": "I have developed... other interests.",
