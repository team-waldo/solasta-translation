"The Guild of Antiquarians grew up as an informal information-sharing network "
"within the Snow Alliance, composed of those explorers and scholars intrepid "
"enough to study the Marches. Over the last couple of centuries it has "
"coalesced into a more-or-less formal organization that mimics the structure "
"of a university."

"Tomaz,\n"
"\n"
"I do hope these words find you good health, and I am sorry for not writing "
"sooner. Requisitioning the necessary supplies, and ensuring delivery is "
"risky, and dangerous. But it is well worth it, as your letters have become a "
"shining beacon of hope in the dark nights that haunt this prison.\n"
"\n"
"Your words of concern are not misplaced, as the wound of old is spreading my "
"certain end through my feverish body. Days of labor are more torturous than "
"the last, every disciplinary action leaving wounds that will never heal, and "
"hunger has thinned the veil between reality and dream. I fear this letter "
"may be my last.\n"
"\n"
"Long ago you asked me what crimes lead me here, and I professed my "
"innocence. I could not risk that my beloved thought any less of me. Your "
"worship of my fortitude, determination, and spirit allowed you to draw "
"strength in dark times. I could not allow that to be tainted by my past. But "
"now, in these final days, I understand that I was hardly worthy of that "
"affection. I will never fathom how I deserved meeting you in this crucible "
"of my own making.\n"
"\n"
"When I was young my mother's farm had fallen on hard times. I was sent to "
"the Lady's estate to work as a maid amongst deranged aristocrats. These "
"years were filled with mischievous pranks, brute discipline, and cruel "
"indignities. All of my scars and faults tell of those years. The Lady never "
"burdened herself with guilt, but put the blame solely on the shoulders of my "
"mother. Repressed longings turned into despair, despair into resentment, and "
"resentment into spite, which culminated into a hate-filled second of "
"violence my mother did not survive.\n"
"\n"
"And despite my faults, lies, and my shameful past, you still loved me. I did "
"not fully understand why until the end. You did not need to know my past, "
"for your love is unconditional.\n"
"\n"
"Please, my love, do not look at the past, but to the future. Do not fall for "
"despair as I once did, but let the child birthed of our love carry you to a "
"new beginning.\n"

"I, Nilocyrel Dream-Minder, hereby bear witness of the miracle of light.\n"
"\n"
"As part of a conclave of mages focused on the research of magic and "
"accompanied by the always interfering Imperial agents we were to investigate "
"rumors of the sudden appearance of a seemingly magical construct of light "
"deep in an uninhabited region of Aer-Elai. While fast-traveling through "
"still civilized areas of the Empire, we took notice of strange rumors that "
"had started to spread.\n"
"\n"
"Sightings of creatures, burly as dwarves but almost as tall as the Sitherna "
"itself. Clad in pelts and iron, aggressive and savage. At first we thought "
"some children were exaggerating their encounter with the lonely remains of "
"some scattered dwarves, but later on we were able to study a captive, while "
"resting in a rural outpost. Its stature and surly look were comparable with "
"the dwarves from the northern mountains, if it weren't for the obvious "
"difference in size.\n"
"\n"
"Judging by the still wrinkle-free face it was most likely a youngling and "
"seemed to be able to speak, but neither I nor my more traveled companions "
"could make any sense of the guttural sounds it would utter. My colleague "
"Andariel Silvertongue muses if it would be possible to use magic to "
"understand these barbaric humanoids, but we didn't have time to further "
"research this topic. Maybe our misguided brethren in the east might know "
"more about this kin.\n"
"\n"
"Four days after we left the seat of the Arcaneum, while the darkness of the "
"approaching night started to set in, we finally caught a glimpse of the "
"incident we were tasked to research. I saw the sky burn with cold, "
"otherworldly flames, which were of a kind neither of us had laid its eyes "
"upon before.\n"
"\n"
"It is too dark to continue and while a sight to behold, I sense a feeling of "
"dread coming from this light. I entrust this interim report to an "
"accompanying agent, who will travel back this night to report the "
"coordinates this magical construct can be found at. Tomorrow we will advance "
"further."

"His name was Thuriel Duskfall.\n"
"A childhood disease left him deaf and disfigured.\n"
"He found his sole pleasure in life from fishing in the streams at night. "
"Silent and at peace, he was not judged when alone and in the dark. Thus, he "
"developed a skill that gave him value in the eyes of the sylvan elves, who "
"otherwise viewed him as imperfect and damaged.\n"
"He was also my brother.\n"
"I covered his body with a cairn of stones on the riverbank where I found it."
"\n"
"They had taken his rod and his fish, the bracelet he had from our father, "
"his fileting knife, everything.\n"
"So I tracked them. They were many, and arrogant, but I had little else to "
"do, and all the time in the world.\n"
"Four died before they learned to leave guards at night.\n"
"Two more before they learned to make sure the guards were sober.\n"
"Six of them slept together in a tent; I slit the throats of the three "
"largest and left the rest to their sweet dreams.\n"
"By the time they made Port Harrow they were telling stories of the hordes of "
"night witches who descended upon them from the haunted boughs of Colthannin, "
"drinking the blood of their friends and depopulating entire villages.\n"
"More died there, where they mistakenly believed the crowds would give them "
"safety.\n"
"An envoy from my people came, asking me to stop. I indicated that I would do "
"so the day my brother came back to life.\n"
"I have not done so.\n"
"Stranger, if you find this scroll, by the cairn by the river, I ask that you "
"leave it be, and say a prayer for the soul of my brother.\n"
"Stranger, if you find this scroll, by the cairn by the river, and disturb "
"the cairn, or take the scroll, know that I will find you.\n"
