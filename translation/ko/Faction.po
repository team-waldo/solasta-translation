"I do hope these words find you good health, and I am sorry for not writing "

"risky, and dangerous. But it is well worth it, as your letters have become a "
"shining beacon of hope in the dark nights that haunt this prison.\n"

"certain end through my feverish body. Days of labor are more torturous than "

"hunger has thinned the veil between reality and dream. I fear this letter "
"may be my last.\n"
"\n"
"Long ago you asked me what crimes lead me here, and I professed my "
"innocence. I could not risk that my beloved thought any less of me. Your "
"worship of my fortitude, determination, and spirit allowed you to draw "
"strength in dark times. I could not allow that to be tainted by my past. But "
"now, in these final days, I understand that I was hardly worthy of that "
"affection. I will never fathom how I deserved meeting you in this crucible "
"of my own making.\n"
"\n"
"When I was young my mother's farm had fallen on hard times. I was sent to "
"the Lady's estate to work as a maid amongst deranged aristocrats. These "
"years were filled with mischievous pranks, brute discipline, and cruel "
"indignities. All of my scars and faults tell of those years. The Lady never "
"burdened herself with guilt, but put the blame solely on the shoulders of my "
"mother. Repressed longings turned into despair, despair into resentment, and "
"resentment into spite, which culminated into a hate-filled second of "
"violence my mother did not survive.\n"
"\n"
"And despite my faults, lies, and my shameful past, you still loved me. I did "
"not fully understand why until the end. You did not need to know my past, "
"for your love is unconditional.\n"

"Please, my love, do not look at the past, but to the future. Do not fall for "
"despair as I once did, but let the child birthed of our love carry you to a "
"new beginning.\n"

"수송을 관리하는 것은 위험한 일이에요. 하지만 당신의 편지가 이 감옥에 깃든 어두운 밤들에서 빛나는 희망의 불꽃이 되기 때문에 그만한 "

"말해주고 있네요. 그 부인은 절대 자신의 잘못을 인정하지 않았고, 오로지 제 어머니에게 모든 비난을 퍼부었습니다. 억눌러진 열망은 "
"절망으로, 절망은 분노로, 분노는 원한으로 변했고, 그 원한은 제 어머니가 견딜 수 없었던 증오로 가득 찬 찰나의 폭력으로 끝이 "
"났답니다. \n"
"\n"
"그리고 제 잘못, 거짓말, 그리고 부끄러운 과거에도 불구하고 당신은 여전히 나를 사랑해주었죠. 저는 죽을 때까지 당신이 어째서 나를 "
"사랑했는지 이해하지 못하겠어요. 그 사랑은 무조건적이었기에, 당신은 제 과거를 알 필요도 없었죠. \n"
"\n"
"내 사랑, 부탁이니 과거를 돌아보지 말고 미래를 봐요. 내가 한때 그랬던 것처럼 절망에 빠지지 말아요. 다만 우리의 사랑으로 태어난 "

"As part of a conclave of mages focused on the research of magic and "

"\n"
"Sightings of creatures, burly as dwarves but almost as tall as the Sitherna "
"itself. Clad in pelts and iron, aggressive and savage. At first we thought "
"some children were exaggerating their encounter with the lonely remains of "
"some scattered dwarves, but later on we were able to study a captive, while "
"resting in a rural outpost. Its stature and surly look were comparable with "
"the dwarves from the northern mountains, if it weren't for the obvious "
"difference in size.\n"
"\n"
"Judging by the still wrinkle-free face it was most likely a youngling and "
"seemed to be able to speak, but neither I nor my more traveled companions "
"could make any sense of the guttural sounds it would utter. My colleague "
"Andariel Silvertongue muses if it would be possible to use magic to "
"understand these barbaric humanoids, but we didn't have time to further "
"research this topic. Maybe our misguided brethren in the east might know "
"more about this kin.\n"

"Four days after we left the seat of the Arcaneum, while the darkness of the "
