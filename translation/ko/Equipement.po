"We had heard rumors, and then most of the elven troops garrisoned in our "
"Valley left through the Gates to meet a dire threat, yet with enough left "
"behind to ensure that imperial law still reigned supreme! \n"
"On this direst of days, the sky broke, lightning fell again and again, and - "
"worst of all - magic failed! I remember quite vividly the ashen face of our "
"resident wizard, a young scion of a minor branch of House Airgetine, as he "
"told Eldoril Sharp-Blade, the officer left in charge of the Vale, that mana "
"had disappeared and that he wasn't even able to light a candle with his "
"magic. "

"Eldoril Sharp-Blade, was a no-nonsense elven veteran who quickly realized "
"that none of his contingency orders covered such an occurrence. Like every "
"thrall, I was planning a rebellion against the imperial order. In the middle "
"of the destruction wreaked by this Cataclysm, Eldoril made me realize that "
"our fates were intertwined: Without magic, without the empire behind him, "
"there was no way he would be able to compel us to behave like good little "
"imperial thralls. On the other hand, some of his patrols had brought back "
"the corpses of very dangerous-looking monsters, and his men had the "
"equipment, discipline, and training needed to face such fearsome foes.   "

"If only it had been that simple… The young Airgetine wizard thought himself "
"the equal of a master in wit, if not in power, and managed to convince his "
"personal guard to follow him on a trek towards the imperial heartlands, away "
"from the taint of this travesty of discussion with thralls. As Eldoril "
"didn't want to pitch his troops against fellow elves, he let them go, with a "
"heavy heart. It was the last we heard or saw of them."

"One year after the Cataclysm, I met my first humans. Eldoril was able to "
"tell me they were not, as I had thought, enemies but rather refugees turned "
"allies of the Empire. And what a sorry bunch they were: some elderly, "
"children, women, not many fighting men among them, and they were following "
"an old man, Egil Karst, decked in clothes the color of fire. This first "
"winter had been more than dire, but somehow, the steep walls of our valley "
"had shielded us, and we had room left to shelter those people, provided they "
"could forage for their own food. At that, Egil Karst, the cleric of Arun, "
"gave a little smile and, out of nothing, conjured up a feast for his "
"followers."

"We were all dumbstruck, magic was returning… And yet, our few remaining "
"arcanists confirmed they could not sense mana. Egil confirmed this, "
"explaining that he was only a vessel channeling the mana offered by the gods "
"so that his flock could survive. Those human gods were real, and their magic "
"was functioning. And those humans were all skilled with their hands, not "
"being used to having magic at their disposal for every single task. Soon, "
"they weren't refugees anymore but valued members of our community, helping "
"mend and repair with their hands and stone and wood, instead of with spells "
"and mana. "

"Their expertise was welcome as our foraging parties couldn't wander outside "
"the fortress walls anymore, as the weather and the monsters had redoubled "
"their assault. By now, even the fiercest of the anti-Manacalon among my "
"miners approve of our tentative partnership with their erstwhile guards, as "
"they have shown us that, no matter what their faults, their courage more "
"than makes up for them. \n"

"It all began as a series of raids, pinpricks outside our walls, attacks on "
"caravans. Enough to worry us and elicit a response, but nothing more! Alas! "

"And so the force we sent after the raiders got wiped out, almost to the last "
"man. It was more than a raid from an orcish clan; it was a full invasion "
"aimed at conquering our vale! We were almost surprised at the gates, but "
"managed to close them in time! We had lost our finest but our walls were "
"strong and we were able to produce weapons to replenish our depleted arrows "
"and bolt stocks quite fast. This siege gave us pause, as we didn't quite "
"understand its purpose. The only access to the Vale of Coparann goes through "
"the pass blocked by our town and the fortress. The vale itself is only "
"easily accessible if you can fly! Otherwise, the steep walls provide as fine "
"a natural defense as I have ever seen! "

"And yet, they were so numerous that our numbers began to slowly dwindle, and "

"messengers to relay our plight! "

"at the gate was worn down! And it was in that instance that Gromnir "
"Stonefist and his mercenaries hit the enemy's rear! Fierce was his assault, "
"but cunning too. A series of hit-and-run strikes from many directions, "
"fireballs and lightning bolts exploding, and coming from what seemed like a "
"thousand voices, war cries from known units of the Principality of Masgarth! "
"The orcs thought the rescuers far more numerous than they were, and Captain "
"Stonefist managed to strike hardest at the command group of the orcs, "
"killing the blood shaman who was keeping the clans together. It broke their "
"spirit! We had won, but the cost was great and the feeling in my mouth was "
"mixed! Joris Nikannen saw it and found the words to shake me out of my "
"gloom! "
