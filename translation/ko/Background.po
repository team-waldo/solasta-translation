"An orphan from the streets of Caer Cyflen, Garrad survived thanks to a "
"little luck and a lot of stubbornness.\n"
"He began as an apprentice cutpurse for the Thieves' Guild, but when he grew "
"too big and too noticeable to melt into the crowds with a score, his masters "
"decided that he would make a good crippled beggar.\n"
"\n"
"Unwilling to be maimed for the profit of others, he fled the Guild and the "
"city by enlisting in the army.\n"
"After a couple of years at a border fort near the Kingdom of Gallivan, "
"Garrad hired himself out to merchants as a caravan guard, and spent time in "
"several mercenary \"free companies,\" raiding the Marches in the name of one "
"noble or another. Based on his past experience, he dislikes thieves and "
"their guilds, and shows no mercy to any underworld figures who cross him. \n"
"\n"
"As the Principality began looking for adventurers, Garrad returned to answer "
"the call. More than anything, he hopes that one dark night, in some quiet "
"alley, he will meet the sadistic guildmaster who planned to maim him for "
"profit.\n"

"Rhuad always had a glib tongue and a swift hand, but one day he picked the "

"Under the laws of the Principality he could have suffered a number of harsh "
"punishments, but instead the mage who caught him red-handed - a fellow "
"sylvan elf - sent him to the Treasurer's office for training.\n"
"\n"
"Thus the Principality gained a swift, stealthy, and cunning spy whose greed "
"is kept in check by the knowledge - and by regular reminders from his "
"masters - that any transgression will lead to the swift and inevitable "
"punishment for his original crime.\n"
"Rhuad remains a loyal agent of the Principality. He harbors a deep-seated "
"hatred of the New Empire, where he began his life as a slave."

"Vigdis is the youngest daughter of Kaikkonen Vartija, the current head of "
"the powerful Kaikkonen border clan in the Snow Alliance.\n"
"Since girlhood she was known for her stubbornness and her strong sense of "
"right and wrong. When she learned that her family planned to marry her into "
"an allied clan for diplomatic reasons she left the Snow Alliance, one step "
"ahead of a posse of brothers and cousins sent to recover her. \n"
"Reaching the Principality of Masgarth, she sought sanctuary at the great "
"temple of Einar, refusing to leave despite all remonstrations. Her father, "
"the Kaikkonen himself, traveled to the temple in an unprecedented attempt at "
"reconciliation, but she refused to be persuaded into the political match. "
"Instead, she entered her novitiate in the service of Einar.\n"
"While her family did not formally disown her, it is generally considered "
"unwise to mention her name in their presence. Surprising everyone but "
"herself, Vigdis excelled during her novitiate: offered her choice of service "
"as a reward, she chose to join the wandering Order of the Beacon. Since then "
"she has traveled widely, bringing the light of Einar to all in need and "
"fighting and bleeding for them when necessary.\n"
"Even though she treats all as equals and never puts on airs, her accent and "
"choice of words betray a noble background and a good education, as well as a "
"certain familiarity in dealing with powerful people. Vigdis is a hardy dwarf "
"and a true follower of Einar, and her lifestyle in the Order of the Beacon "
"matches her temperament perfectly.\n"

"Violet is an unusual marsh halfling. Instead of staying safely at home in "

"To make things worse, instead of following the good and sensible path of the "
"marsh mage that originated among her people, she has chosen to become a "
"showy, destructive shock arcanist! \n"
"Her family is mortified. Some of their neighbors whisper that the Good-"
"Cheers have a trace of wild island halfling blood, and have never been "
"sensible… though they are careful never to do so when they can be overheard."
"\n"
"Violet is an idealist, and believes that it is better to be out in the world "
"seeing things and doing good, rather than sitting grumpily in a swamp. \n"
"She sees herself as the first of many Marsh Halfling heroes - well, mostly "
"heroines, as she sees it - who will make the world a better place and win "
"renown for themselves and their people. Her personal philosophy is based on "
"freedom and personal accountability for one's actions. \n"
